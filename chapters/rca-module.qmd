# Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Module {#sec-rca}

## Purpose

The RCA Module defines how the Namma Cloud team investigates incidents, identifies root causes, implements corrective actions, and prevents recurrence. Every incident — no matter how small — is an opportunity to improve.

::: {.callout-important}
## Our RCA Philosophy
We don't do RCA to assign blame. We do RCA to **understand systems, improve processes, and grow as a team**.
:::

## When to Trigger an RCA

An RCA **must** be initiated for:

| Trigger | Example | Timeline |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Hardware damage | Server damaged during transport | RCA within 24 hours |
| Installation failure | Server doesn't fit in rack | RCA within 48 hours |
| Configuration error | Wrong network port connected | RCA within 48 hours |
| Safety incident | Near-miss or actual injury | RCA within 12 hours |
| Repeat issue | Same problem occurs twice | RCA within 24 hours |
| Process deviation | SOP not followed | RCA within 48 hours |
| Unexpected downtime | Server fails after installation | RCA within 24 hours |

: RCA Trigger Events {.striped}

An RCA **should** be considered for:

- Maker-Checker failures (task rejected by Checker)
- Near-misses that could have become incidents
- Process inefficiencies discovered during work
- New learnings that reveal gaps in SOPs

## Step-by-Step RCA Guide

### Step 1: Immediate Response (Within 1 Hour)

When an incident occurs:

1. **Ensure safety** — If anyone is at risk, address safety first
2. **Stop the activity** — Don't continue with the task
3. **Preserve evidence** — Take photographs, don't clean up or fix anything yet
4. **Document immediately:**
   - What happened?
   - When did it happen?
   - Where did it happen?
   - Who was involved?
   - What was being done at the time?
5. **Notify the Team Lead**
6. **File an incident ticket**

::: {.callout-tip}
## Quick Documentation
Use your phone to:

1. Take photos of the incident
2. Record a voice note describing what happened (in any language)
3. Note the exact time

This can be formalized later, but capture it NOW while it's fresh.
:::

### Step 2: Gather Evidence (Within 24 Hours)

Collect all relevant information:

- Photographs (before, during, after)
- Checklists (were they completed? any items missed?)
- SOP version that was being followed
- Statements from team members involved
- Environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, lighting)
- Equipment specifications
- Any prior similar incidents
- Maker-Checker sign-off forms (if applicable)

### Step 3: Build a Timeline

Create a chronological timeline of events:

| Time | Event | Who | Notes |
|------|-------|-----|-------|
| _____ | _____ | _____ | _____ |
| _____ | _____ | _____ | _____ |
| _____ | _____ | _____ | _____ |

**Focus on:** What happened just before the incident? What changed?

### Step 4: The 5 Whys

The 5 Whys technique helps us dig deeper than the surface-level cause:

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-5whys-example
%%| fig-cap: "5 Whys Example — Server Damaged During Transport"
flowchart TD
    P["Problem: Server slightly damaged during transport"] --> W1
    W1["Why 1: Why was it damaged?\n→ It shifted inside the packaging"] --> W2
    W2["Why 2: Why did it shift?\n→ Packaging did not fit the server tightly"] --> W3
    W3["Why 3: Why didn't the packaging fit?\n→ Generic packaging was used, not custom-fit"] --> W4
    W4["Why 4: Why was generic packaging used?\n→ No standard packaging specification existed"] --> W5
    W5["Why 5: Why was there no specification?\n→ Packaging was not included in the SOP"]

    W5 --> RC["ROOT CAUSE:\nSOP did not include packaging specifications\nfor different server types"]
```

::: {.callout-note}
## 5 Whys Guidelines
- Keep asking "Why?" until you reach a **systemic cause** (process, training, tool gap)
- If you find yourself blaming a person, ask "Why?" again — there's always a system behind the human action
- Sometimes you need more than 5 Whys, sometimes fewer. The number is a guide, not a rule.
- Multiple root causes are possible — investigate all branches
:::

### Step 5: Identify Contributing Factors

Beyond the root cause, identify factors that contributed:

| Category | Contributing Factor | Present? |
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| **Process** | SOP missing or incomplete | ☐ |
| **Process** | Checklist not followed | ☐ |
| **Training** | Team member not trained on this task | ☐ |
| **Training** | Training was insufficient | ☐ |
| **Equipment** | Wrong tools or materials used | ☐ |
| **Equipment** | Equipment was faulty | ☐ |
| **Environment** | Lighting, space, or temperature issues | ☐ |
| **Communication** | Instructions unclear or misunderstood | ☐ |
| **Communication** | Language barrier | ☐ |
| **Time pressure** | Rushing to meet a deadline | ☐ |
| **Verification** | Maker-Checker not performed | ☐ |
| **Documentation** | Specifications not available | ☐ |

: Contributing Factor Analysis {.striped}

### Step 6: Define Corrective & Preventive Actions (CAPA)

For each root cause and contributing factor, define:

#### Corrective Actions (Fix the immediate problem)

| # | Action | Owner | Deadline | Status |
|---|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | _______ | _______ | _______ | ☐ |
| 2 | _______ | _______ | _______ | ☐ |
| 3 | _______ | _______ | _______ | ☐ |

#### Preventive Actions (Prevent recurrence)

| # | Action | Owner | Deadline | Status |
|---|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | _______ | _______ | _______ | ☐ |
| 2 | _______ | _______ | _______ | ☐ |
| 3 | _______ | _______ | _______ | ☐ |

**Examples of CAPA:**

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Corrective | Replace damaged server component |
| Corrective | Re-pack remaining servers with proper materials |
| Preventive | Update transportation SOP with packaging specifications |
| Preventive | Create a packaging checklist for each server type |
| Preventive | Add "packaging inspection" to Maker-Checker process |
| Preventive | Training session on proper packaging techniques |

: Example CAPA Actions {.striped}

### Step 7: Update SOPs & Checklists

If the RCA reveals an SOP gap:

1. Draft the SOP update
2. Review with Team Lead
3. Get approval
4. Publish the updated SOP
5. Brief the team on the change
6. Record the change with version number

### Step 8: Share Learnings

Every RCA culminates in a **learning session**:

1. Present the incident (what happened)
2. Walk through the 5 Whys
3. Explain the root cause
4. Describe the CAPA
5. Show the updated SOP/checklist
6. Open for questions and discussion
7. **Key message:** "This is how we get better, together"

## RCA Tracking Dashboard

Maintain a running tracker of all RCAs:

| ID | Incident | Date | Root Cause | CAPA Count | Status | Days Open |
|----|----------|------|-----------|------------|--------|-----------|
| RCA-001 | Server damaged in transport | _______ | Packaging spec missing | 4 | _______ | _______ |
| RCA-002 | _______ | _______ | _______ | _______ | _______ | _______ |

**Targets:**

- RCA initiated within **24 hours** of incident
- RCA completed within **72 hours**
- All CAPA items completed within **2 weeks**
- Zero **repeat incidents** (same root cause)

## Real-World Example: Server Damaged During Transport

::: {.callout-note}
## Case Study: RCA-001
**Incident:** During transportation from the guest house to the data center, one HP server was found to have slight physical damage upon arrival.

**5 Whys:**

1. **Why was the server damaged?** → It shifted during transport
2. **Why did it shift?** → Packaging was not snug around the server
3. **Why wasn't packaging snug?** → Generic padding was used instead of custom-fit packaging
4. **Why was generic padding used?** → No packaging standard existed for this type of transport
5. **Why was there no standard?** → The transportation SOP did not include packaging specifications

**Root Cause:** Transportation SOP lacked specific packaging requirements for different server types and transport scenarios.

**CAPA:**

- ✅ Created detailed packaging specifications (see [Transportation SOP](#sec-sop-transport))
- ✅ Added shock and moisture indicators to packaging checklist
- ✅ Added Maker-Checker process for packaging verification
- ✅ Created separate packaging guidelines for branded vs assembled servers
- ✅ Conducted training session on proper server packaging

**Result:** No further transport damage incidents after implementing these changes.
