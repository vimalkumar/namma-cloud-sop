# SOP: Server Transportation {#sec-sop-transport}

## Purpose

This SOP defines the standard procedure for safely transporting servers from the source location (vendor, guest house, or staging area) to the data center. It ensures that all servers arrive undamaged, properly documented, and ready for installation.

::: {.callout-warning}
## Lesson Learned
During our initial transportation from the guest house to the data center, one server was slightly damaged due to inadequate packaging. This SOP was created to prevent such incidents from ever recurring.
:::

## Scope

This procedure covers:

- Transportation of **any datacenter hardware** (servers, switches, storage arrays, networking equipment)
- Transportation of **branded equipment** (HP, Dell, Supermicro, Cisco, etc.)
- Transportation of **assembled (non-branded)** equipment
- Any movement of equipment between locations (vendor → guest house → data center)
- Both short-distance (within city) and long-distance (inter-city) transport

## Roles

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| **Maker** | Prepares, packs, and supervises transportation |
| **Checker** | Verifies packing quality, documentation, and condition on arrival |
| **Team Lead** | Approves transportation plan, reviews completion |

## Pre-Transportation Checklist

Before any equipment is moved, the following MUST be completed:

### Step 1: Inventory & Documentation

- [ ] Record the equipment's serial number, model, and configuration
- [ ] Take **photographs** from all 6 angles: all 4 sides + top + bottom (6 photos minimum)
- [ ] Record the equipment's weight and dimensions (critical for transport vehicle selection)
- [ ] Update Namma DSL with transportation event (if applicable)
- [ ] Create a transportation ticket in the issue tracker
- [ ] List all removable/loose components (transceivers, power cords, mounting brackets, etc.)

### Step 2: Packaging Assessment

Different equipment types and packaging availability require different approaches.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Component Identification
If you need help identifying components, ports, or connectors mentioned in this section, refer to the **[Hardware Visual Guide](#sec-hardware-visual-guide)**.
:::

#### A. Branded Equipment (With Original Packaging Available)

**Applies to:** HP, Dell, Supermicro, Cisco, Arista, or any vendor equipment with factory packaging.

| Item | Requirement | ✅ Check |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Original packaging** | **Always use if available** — designed for this equipment | ☐ |
| Anti-static bags | Equipment wrapped individually before placing in box | ☐ |
| Foam inserts | Use original foam inserts (do NOT discard or substitute) | ☐ |
| Accessories secured | Power cords, rails, brackets in separate labeled bags | ☐ |

: Branded Equipment Packaging Checklist {.striped}

::: {.callout-note}
## Why Original Packaging Matters
Original packaging is designed specifically for that equipment model:
- Foam is cut to exact dimensions
- Weight distribution is calculated
- Drop test ratings are verified
- Warranty may require original packaging for RMA/returns

**Never discard original packaging until equipment is permanently installed.**
:::

---

#### B. Equipment Without Original Packaging

**Applies to:** Assembled equipment, used equipment, or when original packaging is lost/damaged.

::: {.callout-important}
## Extra Care Required
Equipment without original packaging is at higher risk during transport. Components may not be securely fastened. Plan extra time for custom packaging.
:::

| Item | Requirement | ✅ Check |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Internal component check** | Open chassis (if applicable) and verify all components firmly seated | ☐ |
| Removable parts secured | Remove and separately pack: transceivers, drive caddies, PCIe cards, PSU modules (if removable) | ☐ |
| Cables secured | Internal cables zip-tied, external cables removed and bagged | ☐ |
| Anti-static bags | Full equipment wrap (use appropriate size) | ☐ |
| Custom foam padding | **Minimum 2 inches (5 cm) on ALL six sides** | ☐ |
| Foam type | Closed-cell foam or bubble wrap (NOT newspaper or loose packing peanuts) | ☐ |
| Inner box fit | Equipment must NOT move inside inner padding | ☐ |
| Outer container | **Rigid**: wooden crate, heavy-duty plastic case, or double-wall cardboard rated for weight | ☐ |
| Box strength test | Outer box rated for **2× equipment weight** minimum | ☐ |
| Internal bracing | Add cardboard/foam bracing if equipment moves more than 1cm when shaken | ☐ |
| Fragile + shock labels | All 6 sides | ☐ |
| "This Side Up" arrows | Clear arrows on all 4 vertical sides | ☐ |
| Component list | Printed list taped **inside** box lid listing: equipment model, serial, weight, contents | ☐ |
| Handling instructions | Taped outside: "2-Person Lift Required" if weight > 15kg | ☐ |

: Equipment Without Original Packaging Checklist {.striped}

::: {.callout-warning}
## Foam Padding Requirements

**Minimum padding thickness by equipment weight:**

| Equipment Weight | Minimum Foam Thickness (All Sides) |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| < 10 kg | 2 inches (5 cm) |
| 10-25 kg | 3 inches (7.5 cm) |
| > 25 kg | 4 inches (10 cm) |

**Foam must be:**
- Closed-cell foam (does not compress permanently) OR high-density bubble wrap
- NOT newspaper, tissue, or packing peanuts (inadequate shock absorption)
:::

---

#### C. Equipment-Specific Pre-Transport Checks

Before packing, perform equipment-type-specific checks:

**For Servers:**

- [ ] Remove all drive caddies (even if empty) — pack separately with bubble wrap
- [ ] Check PCIe cards are secured with bracket screws (not just slot pressure)
- [ ] Verify PSUs are locked in place (check release tabs)
- [ ] Remove any USB drives, cables plugged into rear
- [ ] Take photo of rear port layout (helps with re-cabling)

**For Network Switches:**

- [ ] Remove ALL transceivers (SFP, QSFP) — pack in anti-static bags separately
- [ ] Remove power supplies if hot-swappable
- [ ] Check fan modules are secured (some are removable)
- [ ] Coil and secure power cords (do not leave plugged in)
- [ ] Note which ports had transceivers (label with tape if needed)


::: {.callout-tip}
## General Rule for Removable Components
**If a component can be removed without tools, remove it and pack it separately.** Examples: transceivers, drive caddies, hot-swap PSUs, PCIe cards with thumb screws.

Components that require screwdriver to remove can usually stay installed, but verify they are firmly secured.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Visual Packing Examples

**Images needed showing:**

1. **Server/switch in original packaging** — Equipment centered in manufacturer's box with original foam inserts on all sides
2. **Anti-static bag wrapping** — Equipment fully wrapped in anti-static (silver/pink) bag before foam padding
3. **Custom foam padding** — Equipment with minimum 2-inch foam on all six sides in rigid container
4. **Vehicle interior** — Packages secured on vehicle floor with tie-down straps, proper spacing, "This Side Up" maintained

Until photos are available, refer to the detailed packaging checklists above.

### Step 3: Transport Vehicle Preparation

- [ ] Vehicle is clean and dry (no dirt, oil, water)
- [ ] Vehicle has **suspension suitable for fragile cargo** (avoid open trucks with poor suspension)
- [ ] Climate control available (if temperature > 35°C or < 10°C)
- [ ] Tie-down straps or cargo nets available (rated for load weight)
- [ ] Non-slip mats placed on vehicle floor
- [ ] Vehicle has adequate space — equipment must **not be stacked unless packaging is specifically rated for stacking**
- [ ] No sharp objects or protruding fixtures in cargo area
- [ ] Loading ramp or lift-gate available if needed (for heavy equipment > 30kg)

## During Transportation

### Loading Procedure

1. **Minimum 2 people** for lifting any packaged equipment (even if weight < 15kg)
2. **Lift technique:**
   - Lift from the **bottom** of the package
   - **Never** grab by handles, faceplates, cables, or ports
   - Bend knees, keep back straight
   - If package weight > 25kg, use 3+ people or mechanical assistance (dolly, lift)
3. **Placement:**
   - Place on vehicle **floor only** — never on seats or unsecured surfaces
   - Heavier packages on bottom if stacking is necessary
   - "This Side Up" arrows must point up
4. **Securing:**
   - Use tie-down straps — snug but **not compressing the packaging**
   - Straps should prevent sliding, not squeeze the box
   - Use cargo nets for multiple small packages
5. **Spacing:**
   - Leave **minimum 10cm gap** between packages
   - No package should touch vehicle walls (vibration transfer)
6. **Final check:**
   - Push each package gently — should not move more than 2cm
   - Take a **photograph** of the loaded vehicle interior showing all packages secured

### Transit Rules

- Driver must be informed that cargo is fragile electronics
- **Maximum speed: 40 km/h on rough roads, 80 km/h on highways**
- Avoid sudden braking and sharp turns
- If journey > 2 hours, check cargo at rest stop
- No smoking in or near the vehicle
- At least **one team member rides with the cargo**
- Contact Team Lead if any incident occurs during transit

### Route Planning

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|-------------- |
| Road quality | Prefer paved, smooth roads even if longer |
| Distance | Minimize total transport time |
| Weather | Avoid transport during heavy rain or extreme heat |
| Time of day | Prefer early morning (less traffic, cooler temperature) |
| Rest stops | Plan stops every 2 hours for cargo check |

: Route Planning Considerations {.striped}

## Post-Transportation — Receiving at Data Center

### Step 1: Unloading

1. Open vehicle carefully — check if anything shifted during transit
2. **Photograph** the cargo as-is before touching
3. Unload one package at a time — **2 people minimum**
4. Place on a clean, flat, dry surface in the receiving area
5. Never drag packages — always lift

### Step 2: Inspection

For **each** piece of equipment, perform the following:

- [ ] Check shock indicator — was threshold exceeded?
- [ ] Check moisture indicator — any moisture ingress?
- [ ] Visually inspect packaging — any dents, tears, or damage?
- [ ] Open packaging carefully — photograph contents before removing equipment
- [ ] Visually inspect equipment exterior — any dents, scratches, loose parts?
- [ ] Check all ports and connectors — nothing bent or broken?
- [ ] For equipment with removable components: verify all separately-packed items are present
- [ ] For assembled/non-branded equipment: open chassis and verify internal component seating
- [ ] Compare against pre-transport photos — any differences?
- [ ] Test basic functionality if possible (power on, check LEDs, verify POST for servers)

### Step 3: Condition Classification

After inspection, classify each piece of equipment:

| Classification | Description | Specific Examples | Action |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| ✅ **Green — No Issues** | Equipment matches pre-transport condition exactly | No visible damage, all indicators OK, shock/moisture within limits, all components present | Proceed to installation |
| 🟡 **Yellow — Minor (Cosmetic)** | Surface damage with no functional impact | Paint scratches, scuff marks on faceplate, small dents on non-critical metal surfaces, slight discoloration, cosmetic bezel cracks | Document with photos, proceed with monitoring |
| 🔴 **Red — Significant (Structural/Functional)** | Damage affecting function, safety, or warranty | Bent chassis/mounting ears/brackets, cracked PCB, detached component, broken/bent port or connector, loose internal parts, damaged PSU/fan, large dents affecting clearance, missing components, shock indicator triggered | STOP. File urgent ticket. Begin RCA immediately. Quarantine equipment. Do NOT install. Contact vendor if under warranty. |

: Equipment Condition Classification {.striped}

::: {.callout-important}
## Damage Threshold Guidelines

**Minor (Yellow) = Surface Only:**
- Damage is visible but superficial
- No internal components affected
- No structural integrity compromised
- No impact on mounting, operation, cooling, or warranty
- Equipment can still be safely installed and operated

**Significant (Red) = Structural or Functional:**
- Any damage that affects how equipment mounts, operates, or cools
- Any visible internal damage (open chassis/cover and inspect)
- Any bent metal that reduces clearances or prevents proper seating
- Any shock indicator triggered (red showing) or moisture detected
- Any missing components that were documented pre-transport
- Any damage that could void warranty
- **When in doubt, classify as Red and let Team Lead review**

## Hardware Type Reference

::: {.callout-note}
## Applies to All Datacenter Hardware
This SOP applies to **all datacenter equipment**: servers, network switches, storage arrays, patch panels, and other rack-mounted devices. The examples below focus on servers, but the same principles (careful packaging, shock indicators, condition classification) apply to all hardware types.
:::

### Servers — HP ProLiant DL385 (Example)

- **Form Factor:** 2U rack server
- **Weight:** ~22-30 kg depending on configuration
- **Handling:** Use original HP packaging when available
- **Key Vulnerability:** Front bezel clips, drive bays
- **Special Note:** iLO port is fragile — protect during transport

### Servers — Assembled (Non-Branded)

- **Form Factor:** Varies (typically 2U-4U)
- **Weight:** Varies (15-35 kg typical)
- **Handling:** Requires custom packaging — original packaging unlikely to exist
- **Key Vulnerability:** PCIe cards (GPU, NIC), unsecured drive cages, loose cables
- **Special Note:** May not conform to standard rack dimensions — verify **before** transport if it will fit the destination rack

::: {.callout-caution}
## Critical Reminder — Assembled Servers
We experienced fitting issues with assembled servers in our racks. Before transporting assembled servers, **confirm rack compatibility** by checking:

1. Server width, depth, and height match rack specifications
2. Rail kits (if any) are compatible
3. If no rail kits, shelf dimensions are verified
:::

## Record Keeping

All transportation records must include:

1. Transportation ticket number
2. Pre-transport photos (all 6 angles)
3. Post-transport photos (all 6 angles + packaging state)
4. Shock and moisture indicator readings
5. Maker-Checker sign-off sheets (pre and post)
6. Condition classification
7. Any issue tickets filed
8. RCA reports (if applicable)

**Retention:** All records must be kept for **minimum 2 years**.
