# Maker-Checker Process {#sec-maker-checker}

## Purpose

The Maker-Checker process is our primary quality assurance mechanism. It ensures that no single person completes and validates their own work. Every critical task requires **independent verification** by a second person before it is considered complete.

## Why Maker-Checker?

    subgraph Without["Without Maker-Checker"]
        A1[Person does task] --> A2[Same person says 'done']
        A2 --> A3[Errors go unnoticed]
        A3 --> A4[Issues found later — costly]
    end

    subgraph With["With Maker-Checker"]
        B1[Maker does task] --> B2[Checker independently verifies]
        B2 --> B3{Passes?}
        B3 -->|Yes| B4[Confirmed complete — high quality]
        B3 -->|No| B5[Issues caught early — low cost]
        B5 --> B1
    end
```

**Benefits:**

- **Catches errors early** — before they become incidents
- **Knowledge transfer** — Checker learns by reviewing
- **Shared responsibility** — Quality is everyone's job
- **Builds trust** — In the process and in each other
- **Creates audit trail** — Clear record of who did what and who verified

## Roles & Responsibilities

### The Maker

| Responsibility | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| **Performs the task** | Following the relevant SOP step by step |
| **Self-checks first** | Reviews their own work before calling the Checker |
| **Documents their work** | Takes photos, fills checklists, records observations |
| **Hands off cleanly** | Provides all documentation to the Checker |
| **Accepts feedback** | If Checker finds issues, Maker fixes them without ego |

### The Checker

| Responsibility | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| **Independently verifies** | Does NOT assume the Maker got it right |
| **Uses the checklist** | Goes through every item on the SOP checklist |
| **Physically inspects** | Doesn't just look at the Maker's photos — checks in person |
| **Documents findings** | Records any discrepancies |
| **Signs off only when satisfied** | Does NOT sign off under pressure |

::: {.callout-important}
## Critical Rule
The Checker must **never** be pressured to sign off. If they are not satisfied, the task goes back to the Maker. This is non-negotiable.

## What Tasks Require Maker-Checker?

| Task Category | Maker-Checker Required? | Reason |
|--------------|------------------------|--------|
| Server transportation (packing) | ✅ Yes | Prevent damage |
| Server transportation (receiving/inspection) | ✅ Yes | Verify condition |
| Rack installation | ✅ Yes | Alignment and safety |
| Power connection | ✅ Yes | Electrical safety |
| Network connection | ✅ Yes | Connectivity correctness |
| Cable labeling | ✅ Yes | Accuracy |
| Server verification (hardware) | ✅ Yes | Component correctness |
| Power redundancy test | ✅ Yes | Critical reliability test |
| Firmware update | ✅ Yes | Risk of bricking |
| Namma DSL update | ✅ Yes | Data accuracy |
| Daily learning documentation | ☐ Optional | Encouraged but not mandatory |
| Taking photographs | ☐ Optional | But photos should be reviewed |

## Maker-Checker Sign-Off Form Template

Every Maker-Checker task uses a standard form:

---

### Sign-Off Form

**Task:** ________________________________
**SOP Reference:** ________________________________
**Date:** ________________________________

| # | Checklist Item | Maker Status | Checker Status | Notes |
|---|---------------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | _____________ | ☐ Done | ☐ Verified | _____ |
| 2 | _____________ | ☐ Done | ☐ Verified | _____ |
| 3 | _____________ | ☐ Done | ☐ Verified | _____ |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Maker Name:** __________________ **Signature:** __________________ **Date/Time:** __________

**Checker Name:** __________________ **Signature:** __________________ **Date/Time:** __________

**Result:** ☐ PASS — Task complete  |  ☐ FAIL — Issues found (see notes)

---

## Rotation Policy

To maximize learning and prevent dependency:

- **Rotate Maker and Checker roles** regularly
- The person who was Maker for server #1 should be Checker for server #2
- This ensures:
  - Everyone learns both doing and verifying
  - No one becomes a bottleneck
  - Fresh eyes catch different things

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-rotation
%%| fig-cap: "Role Rotation Example"
%%{init: {'theme': 'base', 'themeVariables': { 'clusterBkg': '#ffffff', 'clusterBorder': '#dee2e6' }}}%%
flowchart LR
    subgraph Server1["Server 1"]
        A1[Person A: Maker] --> A2[Person B: Checker]
    end
    subgraph Server2["Server 2"]
        B1[Person B: Maker] --> B2[Person C: Checker]
    end
    subgraph Server3["Server 3"]
        C1[Person C: Maker] --> C2[Person A: Checker]
    end
```

## Handling Disagreements

If the Maker and Checker disagree:

1. **Discuss** the specific concern calmly
2. **Refer to the SOP** — what does the documented standard say?
3. **If still unclear**, escalate to the Team Lead
4. **Document the disagreement** — it may reveal an SOP gap
5. **Never** proceed without resolution

## Metrics & Tracking

Track the following metrics to improve the process:

| Metric | What It Tells Us |
|--------|-----------------|
| First-pass success rate | % of tasks that pass Checker on first attempt |
| Average issues per check | How many items fail per Checker review |
| Time to complete Maker-Checker | Is the process efficient? |
| Issues caught by Checker vs. found later | Is the Checker process effective? |
| Role rotation compliance | Are we rotating as planned? |

: Maker-Checker Metrics {.striped}

**Target:** Achieve **≥ 90% first-pass success rate** within 3 months.

## Integration with Other Processes

- **Issue Tracking:** If a Checker finds an issue, it's logged as a ticket
- **RCA:** If the same issue recurs across multiple Maker-Checker cycles, trigger an RCA
- **Learning Module:** Common Maker-Checker findings become learning topics
- **Namma DSL:** Sign-off data can be recorded in the DSL for auditability

## Remember
Maker-Checker is not about distrust. It's about **building a culture of quality** where everyone takes pride in getting things right the first time.
