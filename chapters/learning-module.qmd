# Learning & Upskilling Module {#sec-learning}

## Purpose

The Learning Module ensures that every team member continuously grows their skills, knowledge, and confidence. Our team comes from diverse backgrounds — some members are learning technical concepts and English language simultaneously. This module is designed to meet everyone where they are and take them further.

## Learning Philosophy

> *"Tell me and I forget. Show me and I remember. Involve me and I understand."*

Our learning approach:

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-learning-approach

flowchart LR
    A["Learn\n(Understand concept)"] --> B["Do\n(Practice hands-on)"]
    B --> C["Verify\n(Maker-Checker)"]
    C --> D["Teach\n(Share with team)"]
    D --> E["Improve\n(Find better ways)"]
    E --> A
```

**Key Principles:**

1. **Learn by doing** — Every concept is tied to a real task
2. **Small daily doses** — 15-30 minutes of learning every day
3. **AI-assisted but human-verified** — Use AI to learn, verify with practice
4. **No judgment** — Every question is valid, every pace is respected
5. **Multi-language support** — Learn in whatever language works best, document in English (with AI help)

## Learning Structure

### Daily Learning (15 minutes)

Part of the daily standup — the last 5-10 minutes are dedicated to learning:

| Day | Focus Area | Format |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| Monday | Hardware Concept | 5-min explainer by Team Lead or video |
| Tuesday | SOP Deep-Dive | Walk through one SOP section in detail |
| Wednesday | Tool/AI Training | Practice using a tool or AI assistant |
| Thursday | Incident Review | Learn from a recent issue or RCA |
| Friday | Open Discussion | Team members ask questions, share learnings |

### Weekly Deep-Dive (1 hour)

Every week, one focused session:

- Hands-on workshop on a specific skill
- Guest speaker (internal or external)
- Video tutorial followed by discussion
- Practice exercise with Maker-Checker

### Monthly Assessment

- Informal skills check (not an exam — a guided conversation)
- Review of learning log entries
- Goal setting for next month
- Celebration of progress

## Learning with AI

### How to Use AI for Learning

AI is your **study buddy**, not your **answer sheet**.

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-ai-learning
%%| fig-cap: "Using AI for Learning"
flowchart TD
    A[You encounter something new] --> B[Try to understand it yourself first — even 2 minutes]
    B --> C[Ask AI to explain it simply]
    C --> D[Read the explanation carefully]
    D --> E{Do you understand?}
    E -->|Mostly| F[Ask AI for an example]
    E -->|Not really| G[Ask AI to explain differently / simpler]
    G --> D
    F --> H[Try to do it yourself]
    H --> I{Did it work?}
    I -->|Yes| J[Write down what you learned — in your own words]
    I -->|No| K[Ask AI what might be wrong]
    K --> H
    J --> L[Share with a teammate — teach them]
```

### AI Learning Prompts

Here are example prompts team members can use:

| Situation | Prompt to Use |
|-----------|-------------- |
| Don't understand a term | "Explain [term] in simple words with an example" |
| Need to learn a skill | "Teach me step by step how to [skill], like I'm a beginner" |
| Troubleshooting | "I see [symptom]. What could be the cause?" |
| Verifying understanding | "I think [concept] means [your understanding]. Am I right?" |
| Language help | "How do I say [phrase in your language] in English?" |
| SOP help | "I'm following SOP for [task]. I'm stuck at [step]. Help me understand what to do" |

: AI Prompts for Learning {.striped}

::: {.callout-important}
## The Golden Rule of AI Learning
**Always verify what AI tells you** by:

1. Checking against the SOP
2. Asking a teammate or Team Lead
3. Testing it in practice
4. Using your own judgment — does it make sense?
:::

## Learning Log

Every team member maintains a **Learning Log** — a simple daily record:

### Learning Log Template

| Date | What I Learned | How I Learned It | What I'm Still Curious About |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| _______ | _______ | _______ | _______ |
| _______ | _______ | _______ | _______ |

**Guidelines:**

- Write at least **one entry per day**
- It can be as short as one sentence
- Write in **any language** — you can translate later with AI help
- **Share interesting entries** during Friday's open discussion
- Team Lead reviews logs weekly (for support, not evaluation)

## Skill Matrix

Track team skills with a visual matrix:

### Skill Levels

| Level | Symbol | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|

| 1 — Awareness | 🟨 | Knows the concept exists |
| 2 — Basic | 🟧 | Can do with guidance |
| 3 — Competent | 🟩 | Can do independently |
| 4 — Expert | 🟦 | Can teach others |

### Example Skill Matrix

| Skill | Person A | Person B | Person C | Person D |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Server handling | 🟩 | 🟧 | 🟩 | 🟧 |
| Rack installation | 🟧 | 🟧 | 🟨 | 🟨 |
| Power connection | 🟩 | 🟨 | 🟧 | 🟨 |
| Network cabling | 🟧 | 🟨 | 🟨 | 🟨 |
| Maker-Checker (checker) | 🟧 | 🟧 | 🟨 | 🟨 |
| AI tool usage | 🟧 | 🟨 | 🟧 | 🟨 |
| English communication | 🟩 | 🟨 | 🟧 | 🟨 |
| Documentation | 🟧 | 🟨 | 🟨 | 🟨 |

**Updated:** Monthly, during assessment conversations.

## Mentorship & Buddy System

### Buddy Pairs

- Pair experienced members with newer members
- Buddies work together on tasks
- Natural Maker-Checker pairing
- Rotate buddies monthly for broader learning

### Team Lead as Coach

The Team Lead:

- Identifies learning gaps through daily observation
- Creates targeted mini-lessons
- Provides encouragement and constructive feedback
- Connects team with resources (videos, AI tools, external help)
- Tracks progress without creating pressure

## Language Support

For team members building English skills:

1. **Technical vocabulary list** — Key terms with local language translations (see [Glossary](#sec-appendix-glossary))
2. **Visual SOPs** — Diagrams and photos supplement written instructions
3. **AI translation** — Use AI to translate concepts
4. **Practice in standups** — Encourage English usage in a safe environment
5. **Bilingual labels** — Where helpful, label equipment in both languages

## Growth Mindset
Every expert was once a beginner. Every skill you have today was once something you couldn't do. Keep learning, keep growing, keep asking questions.
