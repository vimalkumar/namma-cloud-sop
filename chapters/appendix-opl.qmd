# Appendix C: One Point Lessons (OPL) {#sec-appendix-opl .unnumbered}

## What Are One Point Lessons?

**One Point Lesson (OPL)** = A single-page visual quick-reference card that teaches one concept clearly.

**Key principles:**
- **One page maximum** — can be printed and posted at workstations
- **80% visual, 20% text** — diagrams, flowcharts, comparisons dominate
- **One concept** — focused on a single learning point
- **Quick reference** — glance at it during work, faster than reading full SOP

**Origin:** Manufacturing best practice from Toyota Production System / Lean methodology

---

## Three Types of OPLs

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Basic Knowledge (BK)** | Teach fundamental concepts | "How to read a PDU display" |
| **Problem Case (PC)** | Document a problem + solution | "Cable doesn't fit? Don't force it!" |
| **Improvement Case (IC)** | Show before/after improvement | "Proper cable labeling" |

: OPL Types {.striped}

## How to Use OPLs

**At workstations:**
- Print and laminate OPLs
- Post on walls near relevant equipment
- Glance at them during tasks for quick reminders

**During training:**
- Use OPLs to introduce concepts before reading full SOPs
- Visual format helps new workers learn faster
- Review OPLs after completing tasks

**Creating your own:**
- Use the blank template at the end of this appendix
- Focus on problems you see repeatedly
- Keep it visual — use diagrams, not paragraphs
- Get Team Lead approval before posting

## Template OPLs

The following are example OPLs for common datacenter tasks. Print these and customize for your team.

## OPL-BK-01: Cable Type Identification {.unnumbered}

**Category:** Basic Knowledge
**Created:** 2026-02-20
**Purpose:** Quickly identify which cable type you're holding

### Key Points

| Cable | Quick ID | Where Used |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **C13/C14** | 3 prongs, standard size | Server PSU → PDU |
| **C19/C20** | 3 prongs, WIDER | High-power equipment → PDU |
| **RJ45** | Clear plastic clip | Management ports, switches |
| **DAC** | Metal modules, STIFF | Server ↔ switch (same rack) |
| **AOC** | Metal modules, FLEXIBLE | Between racks (long distance) |

## Never Force a Cable
If it doesn't slide in easily, you have the wrong type. Forcing = damaged port.

## OPL-BK-02: Reading a PDU Display {.unnumbered}

**Category:** Basic Knowledge
**Created:** 2026-02-20
**Purpose:** Understand what PDU display numbers mean

### What You See on the PDU

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│      PDU DISPLAY        │
│                         │
│      15.2 A   ← AMPS    │
│      240 V    ← VOLTS   │
│      3.6 kW   ← POWER   │
│                         │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### What Each Number Means

| Display | Meaning | Why It Matters |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **15.2 A** | Current draw in amps | Shows how much electricity is flowing RIGHT NOW |
| **240 V** | Voltage | Electric "pressure" — usually 208V or 240V |
| **3.6 kW** | Total power in kilowatts | Total electricity being used (1 kW = 1000 watts) |

: PDU Display Readings {.striped}

### The 80% Rule

**Never load a PDU past 80% of its maximum capacity.**

**Example calculation:**
```
PDU max: 20A × 240V = 4,800W
80% safe limit: 4,800W × 0.80 = 3,840W
Current display: 3.6kW = 3,600W ✓ OK (under 80%)
```

::: {.callout-important}
## Before Adding Equipment
1. Read PDU display
2. Check equipment power rating (on label)
3. Calculate: Current load + New equipment
4. If total > 80% of PDU max → Use different PDU

## OPL-BK-03: Server LED Meanings {.unnumbered}

**Category:** Basic Knowledge
**Created:** 2026-02-20
**Purpose:** Know what LED colors mean and what to do

### Universal LED Guide

| LED Color | Meaning | Your Action |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Solid Green** | Everything OK | Proceed normally ✓ |
| **Blinking Green** | Activity (data transfer, disk read/write) | Normal — this is expected ✓ |
| **Solid Amber/Orange** | Warning — something needs attention | Note it, report to Team Lead ⚠ |
| **Blinking Amber** | **Critical fault** — hardware failure | **STOP. Do not proceed. Notify Team Lead immediately.** ❌ |
| **Off (No Light)** | No power or no connection | Check cable seating, check power switch |

## OPL-PC-01: Cable Doesn't Fit — DON'T Force It! {.unnumbered}

**Category:** Problem Case
**Created:** 2026-02-20
**Problem:** Cable won't go into port

### What NOT to Do

```
     ✗  WRONG                    ✓  CORRECT

  [Forcing cable]           [Checking cable type]
   into port                  against chart
      ↓                            ↓
  Damaged port             Found correct cable
  $500 repair cost          Works perfectly
```

### Troubleshooting Steps

```{mermaid}
%%| label: fig-opl-cable-fit
%%| fig-cap: "Cable fitting troubleshooting"
flowchart TD
    A[Cable won't fit] --> B[STOP — Don't force]
    B --> C[Check: Do I have the right cable type?]
    C --> D[Use OPL-BK-01 to identify cable]
    D --> E{Correct type?}
    E -->|No| F[Get correct cable type]
    E -->|Yes| G[Check: Is connector oriented correctly?]
    G --> H[Rotate 180° and try]
    H --> I{Fits now?}
    I -->|Yes| J[Connect and verify link LED ✓]
    I -->|No| K[Ask Team Lead — port may be damaged]
```

### DO This

✓ **Check cable type** against identification chart
✓ **Try rotating** connector 180°
✓ **Inspect port** for bent pins or damage
✓ **Ask Team Lead** if still unsure

### DON'T Do This

✗ **Force the cable** — you'll damage the port
✗ **Use excessive pressure** — it should slide in easily
✗ **Wiggle or twist** — gentle insertion only
✗ **Assume "it will work"** — wrong cable = broken equipment

::: {.callout-warning}
## Cost of Forcing
Damaged server port = $500–2000 repair cost + server downtime. Take 30 seconds to verify cable type.

```

### Quick Checks (Do These First)

| Check | What to Look For |
|-------|------------------|
| **1. PSU LEDs** | Rear of server — should be GREEN on both PSUs |
| **2. Power cables** | Firmly seated at both ends (server and PDU) |
| **3. PDU outlets** | Outlets are switched ON (not all PDUs have switches) |
| **4. Front LEDs** | Any AMBER LEDs indicate hardware problems |

: Power-On Checklist {.striped}

::: {.callout-tip}
## Most Common Causes
1. Power cable not fully seated (60% of cases)
2. PDU outlet switched off (25% of cases)
3. Failed PSU (10% of cases)
4. Hardware fault — amber LED visible (5% of cases)

Benefits:
✓ Instant cable identification
✓ 5 minutes to find right cable (was 30)
✓ Zero accidental disconnections
✓ Confident, fast maintenance
```

### Labeling Standard

**Format:** `[SOURCE] → [DESTINATION]`

**Examples:**
- Power: `SRV-042-PSU1 → PDU-A-12`
- Network: `SRV-042-NIC1 → SW01-P24`
- Management: `SRV-042-iLO → MGT-SW-P08`

### Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Label maker available at workstation
- [ ] Labels applied at **BOTH ends** of cable (server end AND PDU/switch end)
- [ ] Label format follows inventory sheet
- [ ] Labels weatherproof (won't peel or fade)
- [ ] Photo taken after labeling (for documentation)

::: {.callout-tip}
## Time Investment
- Labeling during installation: +5 minutes per server
- Time saved during maintenance: -25 minutes per task
- Return on investment: Pays back after 1st maintenance task

**Keep it focused:**
- One concept per OPL
- 3-5 key points maximum
- One page when printed

**Keep it actionable:**
- Include DO/DON'T lists
- Show consequences of wrong actions
- Link to detailed SOP for more info

**Get feedback:**
