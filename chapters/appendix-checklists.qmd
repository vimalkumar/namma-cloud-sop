## Checklist 9: Cable Identification {.unnumbered}

**Use this checklist when you're unsure which cable type to use.**

**Task:** ________________ **Source:** ________________ **Destination:** ________________

### Step 1: Determine Cable Purpose

| Cable Purpose | Type Needed |
|--------------|-------------|
| Server PSU → PDU (standard power) | C13/C14 (3-prong, standard size) |
| High-power equipment → PDU | C19/C20 (3-prong, wider than C13) |
| Server/switch management port → switch | RJ45 Cat6 (clear plastic clip, 8 wires) |
| Server data port → switch (same rack) | DAC (stiff, metal modules fixed to cable) |
| Server data port → switch (different rack) | AOC (thin, flexible fiber) or Cat6A |

: Cable Purpose Reference {.striped}

### Step 2: Physical Identification

**Holding the cable, check these characteristics:**

| Check | C13/C14 | C19/C20 | RJ45 | DAC | AOC |
|-------|---------|---------|------|-----|-----|
| **Connector type** | 3 rectangular prongs | 3 rectangular prongs (WIDER) | Clear plastic clip | Metal module (thumb-size) | Metal module (thumb-size) |
| **Cable thickness** | Medium | Thick | Thin | Very thick, stiff | Very thin, flexible |
| **Cable feel** | Flexible | Flexible | Flexible | **STIFF** — hard to bend | **FLEXIBLE** — easy to bend |
| **Cable length** | Any | Any | Any | Short (1-7m only) | Any length |
| **Will fit in...** | C13 inlet only | C19 inlet only (wider) | RJ45 port | SFP/QSFP cage | SFP/QSFP cage |

: Cable Identification Reference {.striped}

**For visual reference, see [Hardware Visual Guide — Cables & Connectors](#sec-hardware-visual-guide).**

### Step 3: Verify Before Connecting

- [ ] Cable type matches what the SOP specifies
- [ ] Connector slides into port easily (no force needed)
- [ ] Cable length is appropriate (not too tight, not excessive slack)
- [ ] Cable color matches team standard (if applicable)
- [ ] Both ends will be labeled with source and destination after connection

::: {.callout-warning}
## Never Force a Cable
If the cable doesn't slide in easily, **STOP**. You probably have the wrong cable type. Forcing it will damage the port or connector. Try a different cable or ask Team Lead.

## Printing Tip
Print these checklists on **heavy paper** or **laminate** them for reuse with dry-erase markers. Keep a stack of fresh copies at each workstation.
