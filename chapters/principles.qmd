# Principles & Culture {#sec-principles}

## Core Principles

The Namma Cloud Admin Team operates under a set of principles that guide every decision, every action, and every interaction. These are not just words on a page — they are the foundation of how we work.

### Principle 1: Be Curious, Stay Curious {#sec-curious}

> *"The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing."* — Albert Einstein

**What this means for us:**

- **Ask "Why?"** — Don't just follow instructions. Understand *why* each step matters.
- **Explore** — When you encounter something new, spend time understanding it.
- **Question AI** — When AI gives you an answer, verify it. Ask "Is this correct?" and "How can I confirm this?"
- **No question is a bad question** — If you don't understand, ask. If you think you understand, still ask to confirm.

## Daily Practice
Every day, write down **one thing you learned** and **one thing you're curious about**. Share it with the team.

### Principle 2: AI as a Collaborator, Not a Commander {#sec-ai-collaborator}

We are an **AI-first** team. But "AI-first" does not mean "AI-only" or "AI-blindly."

    A[Encounter a Task/Problem] --> B{Do you understand it?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Do it yourself, use AI to verify]
    B -->|No| D[Ask AI to explain]
    D --> E[Read and understand the explanation]
    E --> F{Does it make sense?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Apply it, verify the result]
    F -->|No| H[Ask AI follow-up questions]
    H --> E
    G --> I[Document what you learned]
    C --> I
```

**The AI Collaboration Rules:**

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|-------|---------|
| Use AI to understand concepts | Blindly copy-paste AI output |
| Verify AI suggestions with real testing | Assume AI is always right |
| Ask AI to explain in simpler terms | Skip understanding and just execute |
| Use AI to draft documentation | Submit AI-generated docs without review |
| Collaborate with AI on troubleshooting | Let AI make decisions without human judgment |

### Principle 3: Verify Everything — Maker-Checker {#sec-verify}

No single person completes and approves their own work. Every critical task follows the **Maker-Checker** pattern:

- **Maker** performs the task
- **Checker** independently verifies the result
- Both sign off before moving to the next step

This is not about distrust — it's about **quality assurance** and **learning from each other**.

### Principle 4: Every Incident Is a Gift {#sec-incident-gift}

When something goes wrong, we don't blame — we **learn**.

Every incident triggers:

1. **Immediate documentation** — What happened? What was the impact?
2. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** — Why did it happen? What was the chain of events?
3. **Corrective Action** — What do we change so it never happens again?
4. **Knowledge Sharing** — What can the whole team learn from this?

::: {.callout-important}
## Non-Negotiable
Every incident MUST be documented within 24 hours and have an RCA completed within 72 hours. No exceptions.
:::

### Principle 5: Small Steps, Big Impact {#sec-small-steps}

We break everything into small, manageable steps:

- **SOPs** are broken into individual, atomic tasks
- **Learning** happens in small daily doses
- **Improvements** are made incrementally
- **Confidence** is built one success at a time

### Principle 6: Document Everything {#sec-document}

If it's not documented, it didn't happen. If it's not in a checklist, it might be forgotten.

- Every task has an SOP
- Every SOP has a checklist
- Every checklist is versioned
- Every change is tracked

### Principle 7: Grow Together — 10x Potential {#sec-grow}

Every team member has the potential to do **10x** their current output — not by working harder, but by:

- **Learning** new skills every day
- **Using AI** to augment capabilities
- **Automating** repetitive tasks
- **Sharing knowledge** with teammates
- **Taking ownership** of their growth

## Team Culture

### Daily Standup

Every day, the team meets briefly (15 minutes max) to:

1. **Share** what they did yesterday
2. **Plan** what they'll do today
3. **Flag** any blockers or issues
4. **Learn** one new concept together (5-minute learning moment)

### Language & Communication

Our team is diverse. Some members are still building English language skills. This is a strength, not a weakness.

**Guidelines:**

- Use **simple, clear language** in all documentation
- Include **pictures and diagrams** wherever possible
- Provide instructions in **both English and local language** where helpful
- Encourage **everyone to speak up** — understanding matters more than grammar
- Use AI translation tools when needed

### Recognition & Growth

- Celebrate every successfully completed SOP task
- Recognize team members who identify issues early
- Track and celebrate learning milestones
- Create opportunities for increased responsibility

## Remember
These principles are alive. As we grow, our principles evolve. If you think a principle needs updating, bring it to the team discussion.
