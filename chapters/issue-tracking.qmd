# Issue Tracking & Ticketing {#sec-issue-tracking}

## Purpose

Every issue, deviation, or improvement opportunity must be captured in a ticket. Our ticketing system is the **single source of truth** for what happened, what's being done about it, and what was learned.

## Why Track Issues?

- **Nothing falls through the cracks** — Every issue gets attention
- **Accountability** — Every ticket has an owner
- **Transparency** — Anyone can see the status of any issue
- **Trends** — We can spot patterns and systemic problems
- **Audit trail** — Full history of actions taken
- **Learning** — Issues become training material

## When to Create a Ticket

| Situation | Create Ticket? | Priority |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Hardware damage discovered | ✅ Yes | High |
| Server doesn't fit in rack | ✅ Yes | High |
| Maker-Checker rejection | ✅ Yes | Medium |
| SOP step unclear or missing | ✅ Yes | Medium |
| Cable label incorrect | ✅ Yes | Low |
| Near-miss safety incident | ✅ Yes | High |
| New idea for improvement | ✅ Yes | Low |
| Learning gap identified | ✅ Yes | Medium |
| Equipment/tool needed | ✅ Yes | Medium |
| Question about a procedure | ✅ Yes | Low |

## Rule of Thumb
**When in doubt, create a ticket.** It's always better to have a ticket that gets closed quickly than to have an issue that goes untracked.

## Ticket Structure

Every ticket must include:

### Required Fields

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Title** | Clear, concise summary | "Server SRV03 — alignment issue during rack installation" |
| **Type** | Category of the issue | Incident / Defect / Improvement / Question |
| **Priority** | Urgency level | Critical / High / Medium / Low |
| **Reporter** | Who found the issue | Team member name |
| **Assignee** | Who is responsible for resolution | Team member or Team Lead |
| **Date/Time** | When the issue was found | 2026-02-20 10:30 AM |
| **Location** | Where the issue occurred | Rack A, 15U-16U |
| **Server ID** | Which server (if applicable) | SRV03 / Serial: HP-DL385-xxxxx |
| **Description** | Detailed description | What happened, what was expected, what actually happened |
| **Evidence** | Supporting materials | Photos, logs, checklist copies |

## Ticket Management Best Practices

### For Reporters

1. **Create tickets immediately** — don't wait until end of day
2. **Be specific** — "Server damaged" is not enough; describe the damage
3. **Attach photos** — A picture is worth a thousand words
4. **Use the template** — It ensures you don't forget important details
5. **Follow up** — Check your tickets regularly

### For Assignees

1. **Acknowledge quickly** — Move to "In Progress" when you start
2. **Update regularly** — Add comments as you work on it
3. **Don't close silently** — Add a resolution comment before closing
4. **Link related tickets** — If issues are connected, link them
5. **Trigger RCA if needed** — Don't wait to be told

### For Team Lead

1. **Review all new tickets daily** — During or before standup
2. **Ensure proper prioritization** — Adjust if needed
3. **Track SLAs** — Are we responding and resolving on time?
4. **Spot trends** — Are the same types of issues recurring?
5. **Close the loop** — Ensure RCA actions are completed

## Metrics & Reporting

### Weekly Ticket Dashboard

| Metric | This Week | Last Week | Trend |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Tickets opened | _______ | _______ | _______ |
| Tickets resolved | _______ | _______ | _______ |
| Tickets overdue | _______ | _______ | _______ |
| Average resolution time | _______ | _______ | _______ |
| RCAs triggered | _______ | _______ | _______ |
| SOP updates from tickets | _______ | _______ | _______ |

### Monthly Trends

Track and review monthly:

- **Top 3 issue categories** — Where are most issues coming from?
- **Repeat issues** — Any root causes not fully addressed?
- **SLA compliance** — Are we meeting response/resolution targets?
- **Improvement ideas implemented** — Are we acting on suggestions?

## Integration Note
As Namma DSL matures, ticket metadata will be integrated into the DSL for automated tracking and reporting. For now, maintain tickets in our designated tracking tool and reference DSL entries where applicable.
