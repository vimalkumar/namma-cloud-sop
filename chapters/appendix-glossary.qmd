## A {.unnumbered}

**Airflow**

**Anti-Static Bag**
: A special bag that protects electronic components from static electricity damage. Servers and components should be wrapped in these during transport. See also: [ESD](#e)

**AOC (Active Optical Cable)**
: A fiber optic cable with transceivers built into both ends. Thin, flexible, lightweight. Used for longer distances (10-100 meters) between racks. Fragile — never bend sharply. See also: [DAC](#d), [SFP28](#s)

**Assembled Server**
: A server that is custom-built from individual components (as opposed to a branded server from HP, Dell, etc.). May require special handling due to less standardized construction.

## B {.unnumbered}

**BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)**
: The firmware that runs when a server first powers on. It initializes hardware and hands control to the operating system. Modern servers use UEFI instead of traditional BIOS. See also: [UEFI](#u), [POST](#p), [Firmware](#f)

**Blank Panel**
