## The Server — Anatomy of a Machine

A **server** is a powerful computer built to run 24/7 in a data center. Think of it like a desktop computer, but designed to slide into a rack like a book on a shelf.

### Front View — What You See From the Aisle

**Diagram:**
```
+----------------------------------------------------------+
|  [PWR]                             [LED] O O O           | <- Top edge
+----------------------------------------------------------+
|  +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+        |
|  | 1 | | 2 | | 3 | | 4 | | 5 | | 6 | | 7 | | 8 |        | <- Drive bays
|  +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+        |    (8 slots)

|              [ FRONT BEZEL - Removable Cover ]           |
+----------------------------------------------------------+
           2U Server - Front View (facing the rack)
```

**Key components:**
- **[PWR]** — Power button (top right corner, press to turn on/off)
- **[LED] O O O** — Status LEDs (colored lights: green = OK, amber = problem)
- **Drive bays 1-8** — Numbered slots where disks slide in (like drawers)
- **Front bezel** — Removable plastic cover (may have logo)

### Rear View — What You See Behind the Rack

**Diagram:**
```
+----------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                          |
|  +-------------+                  +-------------+        |
|  |   PSU #1    |                  |   PSU #2    |        | <- Power supplies
|  | (Left side) |                  | (Right side)|        |    (2 for backup)
|  +-------------+                  +-------------+        |
|                                                          |
|  O O O O  <- NIC ports (high-speed network, 4 ports)    |
|  O <- Management port (labeled iLO or IPMI)             |
|                                                          |
|  ================================================         | <- Fan exhaust
|  (hot air exits here - vents with metal grille)         |    (should feel warm)
+----------------------------------------------------------+
           2U Server - Rear View (behind the rack)
```

**Key components:**
- **PSU #1 and PSU #2** — Two power supplies (left and right). Each plugs into a different power source.
- **NIC ports (O O O O)** — Small network ports for high-speed data cables (usually 2-4 ports)
- **Management port (O)** — One special port labeled "iLO", "IPMI", or "BMC" for remote control
- **Fan exhaust** — Vents where hot air blows out (touch it — warm air means fans working)

**Photo: Server Rear View**

![Server rear view showing PSU slots, network ports, and fan vents](../images/server-rear.jpg){width=600px}

*Server rear view. Notice: (1) Two PSU slots - large rectangular openings left and right, (2) NIC ports - multiple small ports in center, (3) Management port - one labeled port, (4) Fan vents - where hot air exits.*

### Server Sizes

| Size | Height | Typical Use |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **1U** | 1.75 inches (thin) | Switches, compact management servers |
| **2U** | 3.5 inches (standard) | Most common server size |
| **4U** | 7 inches (tall) | High-capacity storage servers |

## Analogy
A server is like a powerful desktop computer built to run 24/7, sliding into a rack like a book on a shelf.
:::

## The Rack — Your Workspace Shelf

A **rack** is a tall metal frame where servers, switches, and other equipment are mounted. Think of it like a bookshelf for heavy computer equipment.

```
        ║                                    ║
        ║  [ U42 ] ← TOP (highest)           ║
        ║  [ U41 ]                           ║
        ║  [ U40 ]                           ║
        ║  [ ... ]                           ║
        ║  [ U30 ]                           ║
        ║  [ ... ]                           ║
        ║  [ U22 ] ← MIDDLE                  ║
        ║  [ ... ]                           ║
        ║  [ U10 ]                           ║
        ║  [ U09 ]                           ║
        ║  [ ... ]                           ║
        ║  [ U03 ]                           ║
        ║  [ U02 ]                           ║
        ║  [ U01 ] ← BOTTOM (floor level)    ║ ← Count starts HERE
        ╚══════════════════════════════════╝
             ▓▓▓  Stabilizer Feet  ▓▓▓

        Front Posts (║) = Vertical rails with mounting holes

        [PDU] ← Power strip mounted vertically inside (rear)
```

**Think of it like a building:** U1 = ground floor, U42 = top floor. Always count UP from the floor.

---

**Real Rack Photo:**

![Server racks in a datacenter showing vertical structure and equipment](../images/rack-datacenter.jpg){width=500px}

*Server racks in a data center. Notice: (1) Vertical structure, (2) Equipment at different U-heights, (3) Cable management, (4) Like a tall bookshelf for servers.*

### Key Components

| Component | What It Is | Location |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Front Posts** | Vertical metal rails where equipment mounts | Front of rack, left and right |
| **Rear Posts** | Vertical rails for back support | Rear of rack, left and right |
| **Mounting Holes** | Small square holes running up the posts | Every ~0.5 inches on posts |
| **Stabilizer Feet** | Metal supports that prevent tipping | Bottom of rack |
| **PDU Mounting Area** | Vertical space inside rack for power | Usually rear left or rear right |
| **Cable Management** | Horizontal trays or arms | Between equipment sections |

: Rack Components {.striped}

::: {.callout-important}
## Critical: U-Numbering Starts at the Bottom
**U1 is at the BOTTOM.** U42 is at the TOP. Count from the floor up, like floors in a building where floor 1 is the ground level.
:::

**Rack Unit (U):** One slot on the rack. **1U = 1.75 inches tall.**

---

### Cable Management in Racks

Proper cable management keeps the rack organized and prevents accidents. Here's what good cable management looks like.

**Photo: Cable Management Example 1**

![Organized server cables with proper routing and management](../images/cable-mgmt-1.jpg){width=600px}

*Good cable management. Notice: (1) Cables bundled together neatly, (2) Cables routed along designated paths, (3) Easy to trace individual cables, (4) No tangled mess blocking airflow.*

---

**Photo: Cable Management Example 2**

![Server rear showing organized cable connections and management](../images/cable-mgmt-2.jpg){width=600px}

*Server cable connections. Notice: (1) Power and data cables clearly separated, (2) Cables labeled at both ends, (3) Enough slack for maintenance but not excessive, (4) Cables don't block fans or vents.*

::: {.callout-tip}
## Cable Management Rules
- Label both ends of every cable
- Keep power and data cables separated (≥30cm / 12 inches apart)
- Leave enough slack for movement but avoid loose loops
- Never block fan vents or airflow paths
:::

## Cables & Connectors — Know What You're Holding

When working with cables, you need to identify them by sight and touch. Here's how to tell them apart.

### Cable Identification Table

| Cable Type | Looks Like | Feels Like | Where It Goes | How to Tell Apart |
|------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **RJ45 (Cat6)** | Clear plastic clip, 8 thin wires visible inside | Flexible, light | Management ports, switches | Wider than a phone jack, makes a "click" when inserted |
| **C13/C14 Power** | 3-prong rectangular connector | Medium weight, sturdy | Server PSU ↔ PDU | Shaped like rounded rectangle with 3 holes/pins, like desktop PC power |
| **C19/C20 Power** | Larger version of C13/C14 | Heavier, thicker | High-power servers, switches | Noticeably wider than C13 — won't fit in C13 outlet |
| **DAC (Copper)** | Metal modules permanently attached at both ends, thick black cable | **Stiff**, heavy, short (2–5m) | Server ↔ switch (same rack) | Cannot bend easily, modules are fixed to cable |
| **AOC (Fiber)** | Thin cable, often yellow or orange | **Flexible**, light, fragile | Longer distances between racks | Very thin — **never bend sharply** |

---

**AOC (Active Optical Cable):**

![Fiber optic cable - thin, flexible, often orange or yellow](../images/cable-fiber.jpg){width=400px}

*Fiber optic cable (AOC type). Notice: (1) Thin and flexible, (2) Often orange or yellow, (3) Fragile - never bend sharply. Used for longer distances.*

---

**C19/C20 Power Cables (High-Power):**

![C19 high-power connector - wider than C13](../images/cable-c19.jpg){width=400px}

## Never Force a Cable
If a cable does not slide in easily, **STOP.** You probably have the wrong cable type. **Never force any cable or connector** — you'll damage the port or the cable.
:::

## Optics & Modules — The Small Metal Pieces

**SFP/QSFP modules** are small metal adapters that click into cages on servers or switches. Think of them like USB plugs, but for high-speed networking.

### Module Sizes

| Module Type | Size | Speed | How to Identify |
|-------------|------|-------|-----------------|
| **SFP28** | Thumb-size (smallest) | 25 Gbps | Single small metal rectangle |
| **QSFP28** | Two-thumb size (wider) | 100 Gbps | Wider than SFP28 |
| **QSFP-DD** | Widest | 200–400 Gbps | Noticeably larger than QSFP28 |

: Network Module Types {.striped}

### Key Rule

**The module size must match the cage size** on the server or switch. If it doesn't fit easily, it's the wrong type. **Don't force it.**

::: {.callout-tip}
## DAC vs Module
**DAC cables** have modules permanently attached at both ends — you cannot remove them.

**Separate modules** (SFP28, QSFP28) click into the equipment first, then you plug a fiber cable into the module.
:::

---

**Visual Examples:**

**SFP Module:**

![SFP transceiver module - small metal rectangle about thumb-size](../images/module-sfp.png){width=300px}

*SFP module (transceiver). Notice: (1) Small metal rectangle - thumb-size, (2) Clicks into cage on server/switch, (3) Fiber cable plugs into front.*

---

**QSFP Module:**

![QSFP module - wider than SFP, about two-thumb size](../images/module-qsfp.jpg){width=300px}

*QSFP module. Notice: (1) Wider than SFP - two-thumb size, (2) Used for 100Gbps or 400Gbps, (3) Larger cage needed.*

## Tools of the Trade

These are the tools referenced in the SOPs. Know what each one looks like and how to use it.

| Tool | What It Looks Like | How to Use It |
|------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Spirit Level** | Small tube with liquid and a bubble, ruler-shaped | Place on surface. If the bubble is centered between the two lines, the surface is level. |
| **Anti-Static Wrist Strap** | Bracelet with a wire and metal clip at the end | Wear on wrist. Clip the metal end to **bare metal** on the rack (not painted surface). |
| **Cage Nut Tool** | Small metal tool with a hook on the end | Slides cage nuts into rack mounting holes. Ask Team Lead to demonstrate first time. |
| **Label Maker** | Handheld device that prints sticky labels | Type the cable ID, print, peel, stick label on both ends of the cable. |
| **Cable Tester** | Small device with two connectors and LED lights | Plug each end of the cable into the tester. Green lights = cable working. |
| **Screwdriver Set** | Phillips (cross-head) and flat-head | Phillips for most server screws. Flat-head for some older equipment. |
| **Flashlight / Headlamp** | Battery-powered light | Use headlamp when you need both hands free. |

: Common Tools Used in SOPs {.striped}

::: {.callout-tip}
## Spirit Level — How to Read It
Place the level on the surface. Look at the bubble inside the tube.

- **Bubble between the two lines** = surface is level ✅
- **Bubble to the left** = left side is higher
- **Bubble to the right** = right side is higher

## LED Color Guide — Universal Reference

Almost all datacenter equipment has LED lights showing status. Here's what the colors mean.

| LED Pattern | What It Means | What to Do |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| **Solid Green** | Everything OK | Proceed normally |
| **Blinking Green** | Activity (network traffic, disk reading/writing) | Normal — keep working |
| **Solid Amber/Orange** | Warning — something needs attention | Note it, report to Team Lead |
| **Blinking Amber** | Critical fault — something is broken | **STOP.** Do not proceed. Notify Team Lead immediately. |
| **Off (No Light)** | No power or no connection | Check cable seating, check power switch |

: LED Status Indicators {.striped}

::: {.callout-important}
## Blinking Amber = Stop
If you see a **blinking amber LED** on any equipment, **stop what you're doing** and notify the Team Lead. This indicates a critical fault.
