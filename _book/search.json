Our team has already faced real challenges:\n\nA server was damaged during transportation due to inadequate packaging\nAssembled (non-branded) servers did not fit well into standard racks\nAlignment issues were discovered during rack fitting\n\nEach of these incidents taught us something valuable.

    "text": "2.1.1 Principle 1: Be Curious, Stay Curious\n\n“The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.” — Albert Einstein\n\nWhat this means for us:\n\nAsk “Why?” — Don’t just follow instructions. Understand why each step matters.\nExplore — When you encounter something new, spend time understanding it.\nQuestion AI — When AI gives you an answer, verify it. Ask “Is this correct?” and “How can I confirm this?”\nNo question is a bad question — If you don’t understand, ask. If you think you understand, still ask to confirm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily Practice\n\n\n\nEvery day, write down one thing you learned and one thing you’re curious about. Share it with the team.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Principle 2: AI as a Collaborator, Not a Commander\nWe are an AI-first team. But “AI-first” does not mean “AI-only” or “AI-blindly.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[Encounter a Task/Problem] --&gt; B{Do you understand it?}\n    B --&gt;|Yes| C[Do it yourself, use AI to verify]\n    B --&gt;|No| D[Ask AI to explain]\n    D --&gt; E[Read and understand the explanation]\n    E --&gt; F{Does it make sense?}\n    F --&gt;|Yes| G[Apply it, verify the result]\n    F --&gt;|No| H[Ask AI follow-up questions]\n    H --&gt; E\n    G --&gt; I[Document what you learned]\n    C --&gt; I\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: The Right Way to Use AI\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AI Collaboration Rules:\n\nAI Collaboration Guidelines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n✅ Do\n❌ Don’t\n\n\n\n\nUse AI to understand concepts\nBlindly copy-paste AI output\n\n\nVerify AI suggestions with real testing\nAssume AI is always right\n\n\nAsk AI to explain in simpler terms\nSkip understanding and just execute\n\n\nUse AI to draft documentation\nSubmit AI-generated docs without review\n\n\nCollaborate with AI on troubleshooting\nLet AI make decisions without human judgment\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Principle 3: Verify Everything — Maker-Checker\nNo single person completes and approves their own work. Every critical task follows the Maker-Checker pattern:\n\nMaker performs the task\nChecker independently verifies the result\nBoth sign off before moving to the next step\n\nThis is not about distrust — it’s about quality assurance and learning from each other.\n\n\n2.1.4 Principle 4: Every Incident Is a Gift\nWhen something goes wrong, we don’t blame — we learn.\nEvery incident triggers:\n\nImmediate documentation — What happened? What was the impact?\nRoot Cause Analysis (RCA) — Why did it happen? What was the chain of events?\nCorrective Action — What do we change so it never happens again?\nKnowledge Sharing — What can the whole team learn from this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Negotiable\n\n\n\nEvery incident MUST be documented within 24 hours and have an RCA completed within 72 hours. No exceptions.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Principle 5: Small Steps, Big Impact\nWe break everything into small, manageable steps:\n\nSOPs are broken into individual, atomic tasks\nLearning happens in small daily doses\nImprovements are made incrementally\nConfidence is built one success at a time\n\n\n\n2.1.6 Principle 6: Document Everything\nIf it’s not documented, it didn’t happen. If it’s not in a checklist, it might be forgotten.\n\nEvery task has an SOP\nEvery SOP has a checklist\nEvery checklist is versioned\nEvery change is tracked\n\n\n\n2.1.7 Principle 7: Grow Together — 10x Potential\nEvery team member has the potential to do 10x their current output — not by working harder, but by:\n\nLearning new skills every day\nUsing AI to augment capabilities\nAutomating repetitive tasks\nSharing knowledge with teammates\nTaking ownership of their growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngantt\n    title Team Growth Path\n    dateFormat  YYYY-MM\n    axisFormat  %b %Y\n    section Foundation\n    Basic SOPs & Checklists       :done, 2026-01, 2026-03\n    Physical Server Operations    :active, 2026-01, 2026-04\n    section Intermediate\n    Networking Fundamentals       : 2026-03, 2026-06\n    Linux & OS Basics             : 2026-03, 2026-06\n    Namma DSL Usage               : 2026-04, 2026-07\n    section Advanced\n    OpenStack Operations          : 2026-06, 2026-09\n    Kubernetes Basics             : 2026-07, 2026-10\n    Monitoring & Troubleshooting  : 2026-08, 2026-11\n    section Expert\n    Full Stack Cloud Operations   : 2026-10, 2027-01\n    Capacity Planning & Scaling   : 2026-11, 2027-02\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Team Growth Trajectory",

Pull back, check alignment, check for obstructions (cables, misaligned rails), and try again.\n\n\n\n\n5.5.3 Step 3: Alignment Verification\nAfter mounting, verify:\n\nPost-Mount Alignment Checks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck\nHow to Verify\nStatus\n\n\n\n\nServer is level\nSpirit level on top of server\n☐\n\n\nServer is centered\nEqual gap left and right\n☐\n\n\nServer is fully seated\nFront face is flush with rack posts\n☐\n\n\nFront panel accessible\nAll buttons and indicators visible\n☐\n\n\nDrive bays accessible\nDrives can be inserted/removed\n☐\n\n\nRear ports accessible\nAll rear ports reachable from behind rack\n☐\n\n\nNo contact with neighbors\nGap exists above and below\n☐\n\n\nAirflow path clear\nFront intake and rear exhaust unobstructed\n☐\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5.4 Step 4: Label the Server\nImmediately after mounting:\n\nAttach a label to the front of the server with:\n\nServer name/ID\nRack position (e.g., “Rack A, 15U-16U”)\nSerial number\nDate of installation\n\nAttach a label to the rear with:\n\nServer name/ID\nNetwork port assignments",
