Our team comes from diverse backgrounds — some members are learning technical concepts and English language simultaneously. This module is designed to meet everyone where they are and take them further.\n\n## Learning Philosophy\n\n> *\"Tell me and I forget. Show me and I remember. Involve me and I understand.\"*\n\nOur learning approach:\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| label: fig-learning-approach\n%%| fig-cap: \"Namma Cloud Learning Approach\"\nflowchart LR\n    A[\"Learn\\n(Understand concept)\"] --> B[\"Do\\n(Practice hands-on)\"]\n    B --> C[\"Verify\\n(Maker-Checker)\"]\n    C --> D[\"Teach\\n(Share with team)\"]\n    D --> E[\"Improve\\n(Find better ways)\"]\n    E --> A\n```\n\n**Key Principles:**\n\n1. **Learn by doing** — Every concept is tied to a real task\n2. **Small daily doses** — 15-30 minutes of learning every day\n3. **AI-assisted but human-verified** — Use AI to learn, verify with practice\n4. **No judgment** — Every question is valid, every pace is respected\n5. **Multi-language support** — Learn in whatever language works best, document in English (with AI help)\n\n## Learning Structure\n\n### Daily Learning (15 minutes)\n\nPart of the daily standup — the last 5-10 minutes are dedicated to learning:\n\n| Day | Focus Area | Format |\n|-----|-----------|--------|\n| Monday | Hardware Concept | 5-min explainer by Team Lead or video |\n| Tuesday | SOP Deep-Dive | Walk through one SOP section in detail |\n| Wednesday | Tool/AI Training | Practice using a tool or AI assistant |\n| Thursday | Incident Review | Learn from a recent issue or RCA |\n| Friday | Open Discussion | Team members ask questions, share learnings |\n\n: Daily Learning Schedule {.striped}\n\n### Weekly Deep-Dive (1 hour)\n\nEvery week, one focused session:\n\n- Hands-on workshop on a specific skill\n- Guest speaker (internal or external)\n- Video tutorial followed by discussion\n- Practice exercise with Maker-Checker\n\n### Monthly Assessment\n\n- Informal skills check (not an exam — a guided conversation)\n- Review of learning log entries\n- Goal setting for next month\n- Celebration of progress\n\n## Learning Tracks\n\n### Track 1: Physical Infrastructure (Months 1-3)\n\n| Week | Topic | Learning Goal | Practice Activity |\n|------|-------|--------------|-------------------|\n| 1 | Server Hardware Basics | Identify server components | Open a server, name each part |\n| 2 | Server Types | Understand rack, tower, blade | Compare HP DL385 vs assembled |\n| 3 | Rack Infrastructure | Understand U sizing, rails, shelves | Measure and map a rack |\n| 4 | Safe Handling | Lifting, ESD, packaging | Practice packing a server |\n| 5 | Power Systems | PDU, UPS, redundancy | Trace power path in data center |\n| 6 | Network Cabling | Cable types, connectors, labeling | Make and label a patch cable |\n| 7 | Server Installation | Full rack installation process | Install a server (supervised) |\n| 8 | Server Verification | POST, BIOS, health checks | Verify a server using checklist |\n| 9 | Troubleshooting Basics | Common issues and solutions | Diagnose a simulated problem |\n| 10 | Cable Management | Standards, routing, documentation | Re-route cables in a rack |\n| 11 | Environmental Monitoring | Temperature, humidity, airflow | Read and interpret sensor data |\n| 12 | Review & Assessment | Comprehensive review | Full server install, solo (checked) |\n\n: Track 1: Physical Infrastructure Curriculum {.striped}\n\n### Track 2: Networking Fundamentals (Months 3-6)\n\n| Week | Topic | Learning Goal |\n|------|-------|--------------|\n| 1-2 | What is a Network?
