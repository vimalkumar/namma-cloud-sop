These are not just words on a page — they are the foundation of how we work.\n\n### Principle 1: Be Curious, Stay Curious {#sec-curious}\n\n> *\"The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.\"* — Albert Einstein\n\n**What this means for us:**\n\n- **Ask \"Why?\"** — Don't just follow instructions. Understand *why* each step matters.\n- **Explore** — When you encounter something new, spend time understanding it.\n- **Question AI** — When AI gives you an answer, verify it. Ask \"Is this correct?\" and \"How can I confirm this?\"\n- **No question is a bad question** — If you don't understand, ask. If you think you understand, still ask to confirm.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Daily Practice\nEvery day, write down **one thing you learned** and **one thing you're curious about**. Share it with the team.\n:::\n\n### Principle 2: AI as a Collaborator, Not a Commander {#sec-ai-collaborator}\n\nWe are an **AI-first** team. But \"AI-first\" does not mean \"AI-only\" or \"AI-blindly.\"\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| label: fig-ai-collaboration\n%%| fig-cap: \"The Right Way to Use AI\"\nflowchart TD\n    A[Encounter a Task/Problem] --> B{Do you understand it?}\n    B -->|Yes| C[Do it yourself, use AI to verify]\n    B -->|No| D[Ask AI to explain]\n    D --> E[Read and understand the explanation]\n    E --> F{Does it make sense?}\n    F -->|Yes| G[Apply it, verify the result]\n    F -->|No| H[Ask AI follow-up questions]\n    H --> E\n    G --> I[Document what you learned]\n    C --> I\n```\n\n**The AI Collaboration Rules:**\n\n| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |\n|-------|---------|\n| Use AI to understand concepts | Blindly copy-paste AI output |\n| Verify AI suggestions with real testing | Assume AI is always right |\n| Ask AI to explain in simpler terms | Skip understanding and just execute |\n| Use AI to draft documentation | Submit AI-generated docs without review |\n| Collaborate with AI on troubleshooting | Let AI make decisions without human judgment |\n\n: AI Collaboration Guidelines {.striped}\n\n### Principle 3: Verify Everything — Maker-Checker {#sec-verify}\n\nNo single person completes and approves their own work. Every critical task follows the **Maker-Checker** pattern:\n\n- **Maker** performs the task\n- **Checker** independently verifies the result\n- Both sign off before moving to the next step\n\nThis is not about distrust — it's about **quality assurance** and **learning from each other**.\n\n### Principle 4: Every Incident Is a Gift {#sec-incident-gift}\n\nWhen something goes wrong, we don't blame — we **learn**.\n\nEvery incident triggers:\n\n1. **Immediate documentation** — What happened? What was the impact?\n2. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** — Why did it happen? What was the chain of events?\n3. **Corrective Action** — What do we change so it never happens again?\n4. **Knowledge Sharing** — What can the whole team learn from this?\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## Non-Negotiable\nEvery incident MUST be documented within 24 hours and have an RCA completed within 72 hours. No exceptions.\n:::\n\n### Principle 5: Small Steps, Big Impact {#sec-small-steps}\n\nWe break everything into small, manageable steps:\n\n- **SOPs** are broken into individual, atomic tasks\n- **Learning** happens in small daily doses\n- **Improvements** are made incrementally\n- **Confidence** is built one success at a time\n\n### Principle 6: Document Everything {#sec-document}\n\nIf it's not documented, it didn't happen. If it's not in a checklist, it might be forgotten.\n\n- Every task has an SOP\n- Every SOP has a checklist\n- Every checklist is versioned\n- Every change is tracked\n\n### Principle 7: Grow Together — 10x Potential {#sec-grow}\n\nEvery team member has the potential to do **10x** their current output — not by working harder, but by:\n\n- **Learning** new skills every day\n- **Using AI** to augment capabilities\n- **Automating** repetitive tasks\n- **Sharing knowledge** with teammates\n- **Taking ownership** of their growth\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| label: fig-growth-path\n%%| fig-cap: \"Team Growth Trajectory\"\ngantt\n    title Team Growth Path\n    dateFormat  YYYY-MM\n    axisFormat  %b %Y\n    section Foundation\n    Basic SOPs & Checklists       :done, 2026-01, 2026-03\n    Physical Server Operations    :active, 2026-01, 2026-04\n    section Intermediate\n    Networking Fundamentals       : 2026-03, 2026-06\n    Linux & OS Basics             : 2026-03, 2026-06\n    Namma DSL Usage               : 2026-04, 2026-07\n    section Advanced\n    OpenStack Operations          : 2026-06, 2026-09\n    Kubernetes Basics             : 2026-07, 2026-10\n    Monitoring & Troubleshooting  : 2026-08, 2026-11\n    section Expert\n    Full Stack Cloud Operations   : 2026-10, 2027-01\n    Capacity Planning & Scaling   : 2026-11, 2027-02\n```\n\n## Team Culture\n\n### Daily Standup\n\nEvery day, the team meets briefly (15 minutes max) to:\n\n1. **Share** what they did yesterday\n2. **Plan** what they'll do today\n3. **Flag** any blockers or issues\n4. **Learn** one new concept together (5-minute learning moment)\n\n### Language & Communication\n\nOur team is diverse. Some members are still building English language skills. This is a strength, not a weakness.\n\n**Guidelines:**\n\n- Use **simple, clear language** in all documentation\n- Include **pictures and diagrams** wherever possible\n- Provide instructions in **both English and local language** where helpful\n- Encourage **everyone to speak up** — understanding matters more than grammar\n- Use AI translation tools when needed\n\n### Recognition & Growth\n\n- Celebrate every successfully completed SOP task\n- Recognize team members who identify issues early\n- Track and celebrate learning milestones\n- Create opportunities for increased responsibility\n\n---\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Remember\nThese principles are alive. As we grow, our principles evolve. If you think a principle needs updating, bring it to the team discussion.\n:::\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"number-sections":true,"highlight-style":"github","output-file":"principles.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
