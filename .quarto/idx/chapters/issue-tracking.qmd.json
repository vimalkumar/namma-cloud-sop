Our ticketing system is the **single source of truth** for what happened, what's being done about it, and what was learned.\n\n## Why Track Issues?\n\n- **Nothing falls through the cracks** — Every issue gets attention\n- **Accountability** — Every ticket has an owner\n- **Transparency** — Anyone can see the status of any issue\n- **Trends** — We can spot patterns and systemic problems\n- **Audit trail** — Full history of actions taken\n- **Learning** — Issues become training material\n\n## When to Create a Ticket\n\n| Situation | Create Ticket? | Priority |\n|-----------|---------------|----------|\n| Hardware damage discovered | ✅ Yes | High |\n| Server doesn't fit in rack | ✅ Yes | High |\n| Maker-Checker rejection | ✅ Yes | Medium |\n| SOP step unclear or missing | ✅ Yes | Medium |\n| Cable label incorrect | ✅ Yes | Low |\n| Near-miss safety incident | ✅ Yes | High |\n| New idea for improvement | ✅ Yes | Low |\n| Learning gap identified | ✅ Yes | Medium |\n| Equipment/tool needed | ✅ Yes | Medium |\n| Question about a procedure | ✅ Yes | Low |\n\n: When to Create Tickets {.striped}\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Rule of Thumb\n**When in doubt, create a ticket.** It's always better to have a ticket that gets closed quickly than to have an issue that goes untracked.\n:::\n\n## Ticket Structure\n\nEvery ticket must include:\n\n### Required Fields\n\n| Field | Description | Example |\n|-------|------------|---------|\n| **Title** | Clear, concise summary | \"Server SRV03 — alignment issue during rack installation\" |\n| **Type** | Category of the issue | Incident / Defect / Improvement / Question |\n| **Priority** | Urgency level | Critical / High / Medium / Low |\n| **Reporter** | Who found the issue | Team member name |\n| **Assignee** | Who is responsible for resolution | Team member or Team Lead |\n| **Date/Time** | When the issue was found | 2026-02-20 10:30 AM |\n| **Location** | Where the issue occurred | Rack A, 15U-16U |\n| **Server ID** | Which server (if applicable) | SRV03 / Serial: HP-DL385-xxxxx |\n| **Description** | Detailed description | What happened, what was expected, what actually happened |\n| **Evidence** | Supporting materials | Photos, logs, checklist copies |\n\n: Required Ticket Fields {.striped}\n\n### Ticket Types\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| label: fig-ticket-types\n%%| fig-cap: \"Ticket Type Classification\"\nflowchart TD\n    A[New Issue] --> B{What type?}\n    B --> C[\"🔴 Incident\\nSomething went wrong\"]\n    B --> D[\"🟡 Defect\\nSomething doesn't work as expected\"]\n    B --> E[\"🔵 Improvement\\nSomething could be better\"]\n    B --> F[\"⚪ Question\\nNeed clarification\"]\n\n    C --> G[Requires RCA]\n    D --> H[Requires investigation]\n    E --> I[Added to backlog]\n    F --> J[Answered and documented]\n```\n\n## Ticket Lifecycle\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| label: fig-ticket-lifecycle\n%%| fig-cap: \"Ticket Lifecycle\"\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> Open: Ticket Created\n    Open --> InProgress: Assigned & Work Started\n    InProgress --> UnderReview: Fix/Action Completed\n    UnderReview --> Resolved: Verified by Checker\n    UnderReview --> InProgress: Checker Rejected\n    Resolved --> Closed: No Further Action\n    Resolved --> RCATriggered: Needs RCA\n    RCATriggered --> Closed: RCA Complete & CAPA Done\n\n    Open --> Duplicate: Already Reported\n    Open --> WontFix: Accepted Risk\n```\n\n### Status Definitions\n\n| Status | Meaning | Who Updates |\n|--------|---------|------------|\n| **Open** | Issue reported, not yet started | Reporter |\n| **In Progress** | Being worked on | Assignee |\n| **Under Review** | Work done, needs verification | Assignee |\n| **Resolved** | Verified and fixed | Checker / Team Lead |\n| **RCA Triggered** | Needs root cause analysis | Team Lead |\n| **Closed** | Fully complete, all actions done | Team Lead |\n| **Duplicate** | Same as an existing ticket | Anyone |\n| **Won't Fix** | Accepted risk, documented reason | Team Lead |\n\n: Ticket Status Definitions {.striped}\n\n## Priority Definitions & SLAs\n\n| Priority | Definition | Response Time | Resolution Time |\n|----------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|\n| **Critical** | Safety hazard or infrastructure at risk | Immediate | 4 hours |\n| **High** | Blocking installation or operation | 1 hour | 24 hours |\n| **Medium** | Needs attention, not blocking | 4 hours | 72 hours |\n| **Low** | Minor issue or improvement idea | Next standup | 1 week |\n\n: Priority SLAs {.striped}\n\n## Ticket Templates\n\n### Template: Hardware Damage\n\n```\nTitle: [Server ID] — Hardware damage during [activity]\nType: Incident\nPriority: High\n\nDescription:\n- Server: [ID and model]\n- Activity during which damage occurred: [transport/installation/etc.]\n- Description of damage: [detailed description]\n- Severity of damage: [cosmetic/functional/severe]\n- Photos attached: [yes/no — attach below]\n\nImpact:\n- Is the server usable?
