Every incident — no matter how small — is an opportunity to improve.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## Our RCA Philosophy\nWe don't do RCA to assign blame. We do RCA to **understand systems, improve processes, and grow as a team**.\n:::\n\n## When to Trigger an RCA\n\nAn RCA **must** be initiated for:\n\n| Trigger | Example | Timeline |\n|---------|---------|----------|\n| Hardware damage | Server damaged during transport | RCA within 24 hours |\n| Installation failure | Server doesn't fit in rack | RCA within 48 hours |\n| Configuration error | Wrong network port connected | RCA within 48 hours |\n| Safety incident | Near-miss or actual injury | RCA within 12 hours |\n| Repeat issue | Same problem occurs twice | RCA within 24 hours |\n| Process deviation | SOP not followed | RCA within 48 hours |\n| Unexpected downtime | Server fails after installation | RCA within 24 hours |\n\n: RCA Trigger Events {.striped}\n\nAn RCA **should** be considered for:\n\n- Maker-Checker failures (task rejected by Checker)\n- Near-misses that could have become incidents\n- Process inefficiencies discovered during work\n- New learnings that reveal gaps in SOPs\n\n## The RCA Process\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| label: fig-rca-process\n%%| fig-cap: \"RCA Process Flow\"\nflowchart TD\n    A[Incident Occurs] --> B[Immediate Response]\n    B --> C[Document: What happened?]\n    C --> D[File Incident Ticket]\n    D --> E[Assemble RCA Team]\n    E --> F[Gather Evidence]\n    F --> G[Timeline Analysis]\n    G --> H[Root Cause Identification — 5 Whys]\n    H --> I[Contributing Factors]\n    I --> J[Corrective Actions — CAPA]\n    J --> K[Preventive Actions]\n    K --> L[Update SOPs & Checklists]\n    L --> M[Share Learnings with Team]\n    M --> N[Track Action Completion]\n    N --> O[Verify Effectiveness]\n    O --> P[Close RCA]\n```\n\n## Step-by-Step RCA Guide\n\n### Step 1: Immediate Response (Within 1 Hour)\n\nWhen an incident occurs:\n\n1. **Ensure safety** — If anyone is at risk, address safety first\n2. **Stop the activity** — Don't continue with the task\n3. **Preserve evidence** — Take photographs, don't clean up or fix anything yet\n4. **Document immediately:**\n   - What happened?\n   - When did it happen?\n   - Where did it happen?\n   - Who was involved?\n   - What was being done at the time?\n5. **Notify the Team Lead**\n6. **File an incident ticket**\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Quick Documentation\nUse your phone to:\n\n1. Take photos of the incident\n2. Record a voice note describing what happened (in any language)\n3. Note the exact time\n\nThis can be formalized later, but capture it NOW while it's fresh.\n:::\n\n### Step 2: Gather Evidence (Within 24 Hours)\n\nCollect all relevant information:\n\n- Photographs (before, during, after)\n- Checklists (were they completed? any items missed?)\n- SOP version that was being followed\n- Statements from team members involved\n- Environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, lighting)\n- Equipment specifications\n- Any prior similar incidents\n- Maker-Checker sign-off forms (if applicable)\n\n### Step 3: Build a Timeline\n\nCreate a chronological timeline of events:\n\n| Time | Event | Who | Notes |\n|------|-------|-----|-------|\n| _____ | _____ | _____ | _____ |\n| _____ | _____ | _____ | _____ |\n| _____ | _____ | _____ | _____ |\n\n**Focus on:** What happened just before the incident? What changed?\n\n### Step 4: The 5 Whys\n\nThe 5 Whys technique helps us dig deeper than the surface-level cause:\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| label: fig-5whys-example\n%%| fig-cap: \"5 Whys Example — Server Damaged During Transport\"\nflowchart TD\n    P[\"Problem: Server slightly damaged during transport\"] --> W1\n    W1[\"Why 1: Why was it damaged?\\n→ It shifted inside the packaging\"] --> W2\n    W2[\"Why 2: Why did it shift?\\n→ Packaging did not fit the server tightly\"] --> W3\n    W3[\"Why 3: Why didn't the packaging fit?\\n→ Generic packaging was used, not custom-fit\"] --> W4\n    W4[\"Why 4: Why was generic packaging used?\\n→ No standard packaging specification existed\"] --> W5\n    W5[\"Why 5: Why was there no specification?\\n→ Packaging was not included in the SOP\"]\n\n    W5 --> RC[\"ROOT CAUSE:\\nSOP did not include packaging specifications\\nfor different server types\"]\n```\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## 5 Whys Guidelines\n- Keep asking \"Why?\" until you reach a **systemic cause** (process, training, tool gap)\n- If you find yourself blaming a person, ask \"Why?\" again — there's always a system behind the human action\n- Sometimes you need more than 5 Whys, sometimes fewer. The number is a guide, not a rule.\n- Multiple root causes are possible — investigate all branches\n:::\n\n### Step 5: Identify Contributing Factors\n\nBeyond the root cause, identify factors that contributed:\n\n| Category | Contributing Factor | Present? |\n|----------|-------------------|----------|\n| **Process** | SOP missing or incomplete | ☐ |\n| **Process** | Checklist not followed | ☐ |\n| **Training** | Team member not trained on this task | ☐ |\n| **Training** | Training was insufficient | ☐ |\n| **Equipment** | Wrong tools or materials used | ☐ |\n| **Equipment** | Equipment was faulty | ☐ |\n| **Environment** | Lighting, space, or temperature issues | ☐ |\n| **Communication** | Instructions unclear or misunderstood | ☐ |\n| **Communication** | Language barrier | ☐ |\n| **Time pressure** | Rushing to meet a deadline | ☐ |\n| **Verification** | Maker-Checker not performed | ☐ |\n| **Documentation** | Specifications not available | ☐ |\n\n: Contributing Factor Analysis {.striped}\n\n### Step 6: Define Corrective & Preventive Actions (CAPA)\n\nFor each root cause and contributing factor, define:\n\n#### Corrective Actions (Fix the immediate problem)\n\n| # | Action | Owner | Deadline | Status |\n|---|--------|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | _______ | _______ | _______ | ☐ |\n| 2 | _______ | _______ | _______ | ☐ |\n| 3 | _______ | _______ | _______ | ☐ |\n\n#### Preventive Actions (Prevent recurrence)\n\n| # | Action | Owner | Deadline | Status |\n|---|--------|-------|----------|--------|\n| 1 | _______ | _______ | _______ | ☐ |\n| 2 | _______ | _______ | _______ | ☐ |\n| 3 | _______ | _______ | _______ | ☐ |\n\n**Examples of CAPA:**\n\n| Type | Example |\n|------|---------|\n| Corrective | Replace damaged server component |\n| Corrective | Re-pack remaining servers with proper materials |\n| Preventive | Update transportation SOP with packaging specifications |\n| Preventive | Create a packaging checklist for each server type |\n| Preventive | Add \"packaging inspection\" to Maker-Checker process |\n| Preventive | Training session on proper packaging techniques |\n\n: Example CAPA Actions {.striped}\n\n### Step 7: Update SOPs & Checklists\n\nIf the RCA reveals an SOP gap:\n\n1. Draft the SOP update\n2. Review with Team Lead\n3. Get approval\n4. Publish the updated SOP\n5. Brief the team on the change\n6. Record the change with version number\n\n### Step 8: Share Learnings\n\nEvery RCA culminates in a **learning session**:\n\n1. Present the incident (what happened)\n2. Walk through the 5 Whys\n3. Explain the root cause\n4. Describe the CAPA\n5. Show the updated SOP/checklist\n6. Open for questions and discussion\n7. **Key message:** \"This is how we get better, together\"\n\n## RCA Report Template\n\n---\n\n### Namma Cloud — RCA Report\n\n| Field | Details |\n|-------|---------|\n| **Incident ID** | _______ |\n| **Date of Incident** | _______ |\n| **Date of RCA** | _______ |\n| **RCA Led By** | _______ |\n| **Team Members Involved** | _______ |\n\n**1.
