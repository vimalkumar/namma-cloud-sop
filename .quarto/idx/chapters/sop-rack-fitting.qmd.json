It covers rail kit installation, server mounting, alignment verification, and post-installation checks.\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Lesson Learned\nDuring initial rack fitting, we encountered alignment issues with certain servers, and assembled (non-branded) servers did not fit well into standard racks. This SOP ensures every installation is precise and verified.\n:::\n\n## Scope\n\n- Installation of **HP DL385** servers into standard 42U racks\n- Installation of **assembled servers** (with or without rail kits)\n- Rack preparation and space planning\n- Physical alignment and securing\n\n## Safety First\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## Safety Rules — Non-Negotiable\n1. **Never** attempt to lift a server alone — minimum 2 people always\n2. **Never** work on a rack with the stabilizer feet not deployed (tip-over risk)\n3. **Wear anti-static wrist straps** when handling servers\n4. **Remove all jewelry** (rings, watches, bracelets) before working inside racks\n5. **Use proper lifting technique** — bend knees, straight back\n6. **Ensure adequate lighting** before starting work\n7. **Keep the work area clean** — no loose screws, cables, or tools on the floor\n:::\n\n## Pre-Installation Checklist\n\n### Step 1: Rack Preparation\n\n- [ ] Rack is securely bolted to the floor\n- [ ] Stabilizer feet are extended (front and rear)\n- [ ] Rack is leveled (use a spirit level — check front-to-back and left-to-right)\n- [ ] PDUs (Power Distribution Units) are installed and tested\n- [ ] Cable management arms/channels are in place\n- [ ] Rack unit numbers are clearly labeled (1U at bottom, 42U at top)\n- [ ] Adequate clearance: front (≥ 1 meter), rear (≥ 0.8 meter)\n- [ ] Temperature in the cold aisle is within spec (18-27°C)\n\n### Step 2: Space Planning\n\nBefore installing any server, plan the rack layout:\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| label: fig-rack-layout\n%%| fig-cap: \"Recommended Rack Layout Strategy\"\n%%{init: {'theme': 'base', 'themeVariables': { 'clusterBkg': '#ffffff', 'clusterBorder': '#dee2e6' }}}%%\nflowchart TB\n    subgraph Rack [\"42U Rack\"]\n        direction TB\n        A[\"40U-42U: Network Switches & Patch Panels\"]\n        B[\"35U-39U: Cable Management / Blank Panels\"]\n        C[\"7U-34U: Servers (Heaviest at Bottom)\"]\n        D[\"3U-6U: UPS / Power Equipment\"]\n        E[\"1U-2U: Heavy / Dense Servers\"]\n    end\n```\n\n**Key Rules for Space Planning:**\n\n| Rule | Rationale |\n|------|-----------|\n| Heaviest servers at the bottom | Center of gravity — prevents tipping |\n| Network equipment at the top | Cable runs come from overhead trays |\n| Leave 1U gap between groups | Airflow management |\n| Fill empty spaces with blank panels | Prevents hot/cold air mixing |\n| Plan for 30% future growth | Don't fill the rack completely |\n\n: Rack Space Planning Rules {.striped}\n\n- [ ] Rack layout plan documented and approved by Team Lead\n- [ ] Each server's position (U number) assigned\n- [ ] Required accessories identified (rail kits, shelves, screws, cage nuts)\n\n### Step 3: Server Compatibility Verification\n\n**Before** attempting to install any server:\n\n#### HP DL385\n\n| Parameter | Expected Value | Actual Value | Match? |\n|-----------|---------------|--------------|--------|\n| Form factor | 2U | _______ | ☐ |\n| Width | 482 mm (19\") | _______ | ☐ |\n| Depth | ~734 mm | _______ | ☐ |\n| Weight | ~22-30 kg | _______ | ☐ |\n| Rail kit model | HP DL385 Gen10+ kit | _______ | ☐ |\n\n#### Assembled Servers\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\n## Extra Verification Required\nAssembled servers may not conform to standard 19\" rack dimensions. **Measure every assembled server** before attempting installation.\n:::\n\n| Parameter | Expected Value | Actual Value | Match? |\n|-----------|---------------|--------------|--------|\n| Form factor | _____U | _______ | ☐ |\n| Width | 482 mm (19\") standard | _______ | ☐ |\n| Depth | ≤ rack depth | _______ | ☐ |\n| Weight | ≤ shelf/rail capacity | _______ | ☐ |\n| Mounting method | Rails / Shelf / Custom | _______ | ☐ |\n\n**If the server doesn't fit:**\n\n1. **STOP** — Do not force it\n2. Document the mismatch (photos + measurements)\n3. File a ticket\n4. Options to explore:\n   - Adjustable rail kits\n   - Universal rack shelves\n   - Custom mounting brackets\n   - Different rack (if available)\n5. Get Team Lead approval before any custom solution\n\n## Installation Procedure\n\n### Step 1: Install Rail Kit / Shelf\n\n#### For Rail Kit Installation:\n\n1. Identify the correct rail kit for the server model\n2. Read the rail kit documentation (or watch manufacturer video)\n3. Determine front and rear mounting positions based on assigned U number\n4. Install the **left rail** first:\n   - Align rear hook with the rear rack post hole\n   - Extend rail to front post\n   - Snap or screw into place\n   - Verify it's level\n5. Install the **right rail** — mirror the process\n6. **Verification:**\n   - [ ] Both rails are at the same U position\n   - [ ] Rails are level (spirit level check)\n   - [ ] Rails are firmly secured (try to wiggle — should not move)\n   - [ ] Rail extension mechanism works smoothly\n\n#### For Shelf Installation (assembled servers without rail kits):\n\n1. Select a shelf rated for the server's weight\n2. Install shelf at the assigned U position\n3. **Verification:**\n   - [ ] Shelf is level\n   - [ ] Shelf is secured with all required screws (typically 4)\n   - [ ] Weight rating is adequate (check label on shelf)\n\n### Step 2: Mount the Server\n\n1. **Two people required** — one on each side of the rack\n2. Position the server at rack height, aligned with the rails/shelf\n3. Gently slide the server in:\n   - For rail-mounted: align server rails with rack rails, slide slowly\n   - For shelf-mounted: place server centered on shelf, ensure it's not overhanging\n4. Push server fully into the rack until it clicks or reaches the rear stop\n5. Secure the server:\n   - For rail-mounted: Install front thumbscrews or latch\n   - For shelf-mounted: Use Velcro straps or shelf retainers to prevent sliding\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Pro Tip\nIf a server feels stuck while sliding in, **do not force it**. Pull back, check alignment, check for obstructions (cables, misaligned rails), and try again.\n:::\n\n### Step 3: Alignment Verification\n\nAfter mounting, verify:\n\n| Check | How to Verify | Status |\n|-------|--------------|--------|\n| Server is level | Spirit level on top of server | ☐ |\n| Server is centered | Equal gap left and right | ☐ |\n| Server is fully seated | Front face is flush with rack posts | ☐ |\n| Front panel accessible | All buttons and indicators visible | ☐ |\n| Drive bays accessible | Drives can be inserted/removed | ☐ |\n| Rear ports accessible | All rear ports reachable from behind rack | ☐ |\n| No contact with neighbors | Gap exists above and below | ☐ |\n| Airflow path clear | Front intake and rear exhaust unobstructed | ☐ |\n\n: Post-Mount Alignment Checks {.striped}\n\n### Step 4: Label the Server\n\nImmediately after mounting:\n\n- [ ] Attach a label to the **front** of the server with:\n  - Server name/ID\n  - Rack position (e.g., \"Rack A, 15U-16U\")\n  - Serial number\n  - Date of installation\n- [ ] Attach a label to the **rear** with:\n  - Server name/ID\n  - Network port assignments\n\n## Maker-Checker Sign-Off\n\n| Item | Maker Sign | Checker Sign | Date/Time |\n|------|-----------|-------------|-----------|\n| Rack prepared and level | _______ | _______ | _______ |\n| Server compatibility verified | _______ | _______ | _______ |\n| Rail/shelf installed correctly | _______ | _______ | _______ |\n| Server mounted and secured | _______ | _______ | _______ |\n| Alignment verified | _______ | _______ | _______ |\n| Server labeled | _______ | _______ | _______ |\n| Photos taken (front and rear) | _______ | _______ | _______ |\n\n## Common Issues & Solutions\n\n| Issue | Likely Cause | Solution |\n|-------|-------------|----------|\n| Server won't slide into rails | Rail misalignment | Re-check both rails are at same U height |\n| Server tilts forward/backward | Rails not level | Re-level rails with spirit level |\n| Assembled server too wide | Non-standard chassis | Use adjustable rails or a wider rack section |\n| Assembled server too deep | Long chassis | Check rear clearance, consider mid-mount position |\n| Server vibrates in rack | Loose mounting | Tighten all screws, check rail engagement |\n| Drive bay misaligned with bezel | Server not fully seated | Push server in until fully seated, check front bezel |\n| Cannot close rack door | Server or cables protruding | Adjust cable routing, check server depth |\n\n: Common Rack Fitting Issues {.striped}\n\n## Post-Installation Photograph Requirements\n\nTake and archive the following photos:\n\n1. **Front view** of installed server in rack (with label visible)\n2. **Rear view** showing port layout\n3. **Side view** (if accessible) showing airflow gap\n4. **Full rack front view** showing server in context\n5. **Full rack rear view** showing cable management\n\n## Record Keeping\n\nFor each server installation, record:\n\n- Installation ticket number\n- Server serial number and model\n- Rack ID and U position\n- Rail kit / shelf used\n- Maker-Checker sign-off form\n- All photographs\n- Any issues encountered and resolutions\n- Time taken for installation\n\n---\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Continuous Improvement\nIf you encounter a new issue not covered in this SOP, **document it immediately** and file a ticket. This SOP will be updated based on your findings.\n:::\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../custom.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"number-sections":true,"highlight-style":"github","output-file":"sop-rack-fitting.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
