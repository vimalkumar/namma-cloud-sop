# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the **Namma Cloud Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) Book** — a comprehensive guide for our admin team responsible for building, managing, and maintaining our private cloud data center infrastructure.

## Who Is This Book For?

This book is written for every member of the Namma Cloud Admin Team — from team leads with deep technical knowledge to team members who are learning new skills every day. Whether you are:

- **Transporting servers** from one location to the data center
- **Fitting servers** into racks and ensuring proper alignment
- **Connecting power and network** cables
- **Verifying server health** after installation
- **Learning new concepts** about cloud infrastructure

...this book has clear, step-by-step procedures for you.

## Why This Book Exists

Setting up a private cloud data center is a complex, multi-layered effort. Our team has already faced real challenges:

- A server was damaged during transportation due to inadequate packaging
- Assembled (non-branded) servers did not fit well into standard racks
- Alignment issues were discovered during rack fitting

Each of these incidents taught us something valuable. This book captures those lessons and turns them into **repeatable, reliable processes** so that we never make the same mistake twice.

## A Living Document

This book is not static. As we learn, as we encounter new challenges, and as our infrastructure grows, this book will evolve. Every team member is encouraged to:

1. **Flag gaps** — If something is missing, raise it
2. **Suggest improvements** — If a process can be better, propose changes
3. **Document incidents** — Every issue is a learning opportunity
4. **Use AI tools** — Leverage AI to understand, verify, and improve

> *"We are building not just a data center, but a culture of excellence, curiosity, and continuous learning."*
